#!/usr/bin/env bash
# enforce-single-command.sh — PreToolUse hook that blocks command chaining
#
# Enforces the AGENTS.md rule: "Every Bash tool call must contain exactly
# one command. No &&, ;, or || chaining."
#
# This prevents chained commands from bypassing safety hooks and permission
# checks that evaluate each Bash call individually.
#
# Detection strategy:
#   1. Remove heredoc bodies (avoid scanning their content)
#   2. Collapse line continuations (backslash-newline)
#   3. Scan with a quote-aware awk state machine that tracks:
#      - Single/double quote state (operators inside quotes are ignored)
#      - Parenthesis/bracket nesting depth (operators inside $()/[[]] are ignored)
#   4. Flag &&, ||, or ; found at the top level
#   5. Exception: ; is allowed when the command begins with a compound
#      keyword (for, while, until, if, case, select), since ; is
#      syntactic structure in those constructs — not command chaining
#
# Exit codes (OMP tool_call convention):
#   0 = allow the command to proceed
#   2 = BLOCK the command (stderr message shown to the model)
#
# Hook event: PreToolUse (matcher: "Bash")
# Registered in: .omp/config.yml

# Fail CLOSED: if anything unexpected goes wrong, block the command.
# This is a safety-adjacent hook — ambiguous failures must not silently allow.

BLOCKED by enforce-single-command hook: $1

DAAF requires exactly one command per Bash tool call.
Split chained commands into separate Bash calls:

  Wrong:  mkdir -p /path && cp file /path
  Right:  Two separate Bash calls, each with one command

This rule ensures each command is independently evaluated by safety hooks
and permission checks. See AGENTS.md § "One Command Per Call".

# bash-safety.sh — PreToolUse hook that blocks dangerous Bash commands
#
# This is the primary safety guardrail for the DAAF environment. It reads
# the tool invocation JSON from stdin and inspects the command field for
# patterns that are destructive, privilege-escalating, or data-exfiltrating.
# It also enforces a provenance boundary (section 6): model-initiated shell
# writes to /tmp are blocked because /tmp is outside the Docker-volume backup
# boundary and the audit trail.
#
# Exit codes (OMP tool_call convention):
#   0 = allow the command to proceed
#   2 = BLOCK the command (stderr message shown to the model)
#
# Design principle:
#   Block the dangerous *pattern*, not the tool. For example, `git push`
#   is fine (the permission prompt handles it), but `git push --force`
#   rewrites remote history and is always blocked. Similarly, `curl <url>`
#   is fine, but `curl <url> | bash` is arbitrary code execution. The /tmp
#   provenance guard follows the same principle: reading DAAF's own /tmp
#   coordination caches is fine, but *writing* working files to /tmp is blocked.
#
# Hook event: PreToolUse (matcher: "Bash")
# Registered in: .omp/config.yml

# Fail CLOSED: if anything unexpected goes wrong, block the command.
# This is a security hook — ambiguous failures must not silently allow execution.

# 6. PROVENANCE BOUNDARY — /tmp WRITES
#    /tmp is outside the Docker-volume backup boundary and the audit trail, and
#    the session log viewer renders /tmp paths as broken references. Agents that
#    write working files there lose them silently. The correct home for any
#    temporary or intermediate file is inside the project, which IS backed up
#    and audited.
#
#    This guard is deliberately WRITE-OPERATOR-GATED: it matches only shell
#    operations that *write into* /tmp, never bare /tmp string presence. Reads
#    (cat, ls, head, tail, grep, jq, stat, wc, ... on /tmp paths) must pass,
#    because DAAF's own hooks and statuslines legitimately cache coordination
#    state in /tmp (e.g. /tmp/claude-ctx-window-*, /tmp/claude-model-*) and
#    agents sometimes read those caches via Bash. Reading /tmp and redirecting
#    the output INTO the project is the sanctioned rescue pattern and must pass.
#
#    ACCEPTED RESIDUAL GAPS (covered by the instruction layer — AGENTS.md
#    § Boundaries & Safety > Provenance Boundary — not by this shell hook):
#      - Program-argument writes, where /tmp is passed as an argument to a
#        program that writes there internally (e.g. `python x.py /tmp/out/`).
#        A shell-level regex cannot see inside the program, and blocking any
#        command that merely *contains* a /tmp token would break the read and
#        rescue passes above.
#      - `find ... -exec <writer> ... /tmp/ ... \;`, where the write happens in
#        a spawned subcommand the top-level scan does not decompose.
#    These are deliberately out of scope here; the AGENTS.md prohibition and the
#    config.yml Write/Edit(//tmp/**) deny rules are the compensating controls.
#
#    A /tmp destination is /tmp/ (a path under /tmp) or bare /tmp used as a
#    directory argument. The shared alternative-location hint:
SCRATCH_HINT="Working files belong inside the project (use {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/scratch/), not /tmp — /tmp is outside the backup and audit boundary."

#    A /tmp destination token: /tmp followed by a slash-path, or bare /tmp at a
#    word boundary (end of string, space, or shell metacharacter). Kept as a
#    single reusable fragment so every write-operator check stays consistent.
TMP_DEST='/tmp(/[^ ;|&<>]*)?([ ;|&<>]|$)'

#    Destination-ANCHORED variant: the /tmp token must be the trailing path
#    argument (end of command, optional trailing whitespace). Used for commands
#    where /tmp may appear as EITHER source or destination — cp/mv/rsync/install.
#    Anchoring to end-of-command matches `cp f /tmp/x` (dest is /tmp → block) but
#    not `cp /tmp/x f` (source is /tmp, dest is project → the sanctioned rescue).
TMP_DEST_END='/tmp(/[^ ;|&<>]*)? *$'

#    6a. Output redirection into /tmp: >, >>, 2>, &>, 1>, and the clobber
#        operator >| — followed by /tmp. Covers `head -n 5 f.py > /tmp/x.py`,
#        `cmd 2> /tmp/err`, and `cmd >| /tmp/out`. Reading a /tmp file and
#        redirecting into a project path is NOT matched here, because the
#        redirect target is the project path, not /tmp.

#        at an input-redirect (`<`) or pipe (`|`) boundary, so the sanctioned
#        `tee /daaf/out.txt < /tmp/input` (write project, read /tmp) still
#        passes and a downstream `| grep /tmp` isn't misread as a tee target.

#
#        `ln` is anchored to COMMAND-START position — start of string or right
#        after a command separator (;, |, &) — rather than a bare \bln\b word
#        boundary. `ln` is only two characters and appears inside common flags
#        (e.g. `ls -ln /tmp`, where -ln is the ls long+numeric flag); a word

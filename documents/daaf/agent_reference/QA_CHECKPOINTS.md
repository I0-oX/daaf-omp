# QA Checkpoints Reference

This document defines the continuous Quality Assurance checkpoint system that runs after each atomic script execution. QA checkpoints complement the existing CP1-CP4 validation system by providing independent secondary verification.

---

## Relationship to CP1-CP4

**CP1-CP4** = Primary validation (inline, during execution)
**QA1-QA4b** = Secondary validation (parallel script, after execution)

| Aspect | CP Checkpoints (Primary) | QA Checkpoints (Secondary) |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Timing** | During script execution | After script completes |
| **Executor** | research-executor (inline) | code-reviewer (parallel script) |
| **Focus** | Operation correctness | Output quality & methodology |
| **Trust Model** | Validates the operation | Validates the validation |
| **Output** | Embedded in script log | Separate QA script + report |
| **Failure Mode** | STOP execution | BLOCKER → revision request |

**Why Both?** CP checkpoints catch operational failures (data access errors, type mismatches). QA checkpoints catch logical errors (wrong approach, inadequate validation, methodology drift).

**Cross-Reference:** See `agent_reference/VALIDATION_CHECKPOINTS.md` for CP1-CP4 code templates and checkpoint classification system.

> **Data Onboarding Equivalents:** Data Onboarding Mode uses parallel naming: **CPP1-CPP4** (primary validation embedded in profiling scripts) and **QAP1-QAP4** (secondary validation by code-reviewer). CPP = "Checkpoint Profiling" and QAP = "QA Profiling." See the QAP section below and `data-onboarding-mode.md` for full definitions.

---

## QA Philosophy

QA checkpoints exist because **primary validation has a structural blind spot**: it can only check what the script author thought to check. The code-reviewer's value comes from checking what the author *didn't* think to check — the orthogonal perspective, the creative edge case, the assumption that seemed too obvious to question.

**The QA mindset is adversarial by design.** A QA checkpoint that merely re-runs the same checks as the original script adds no value. Every QA script should include at least one validation that approaches the data from a different angle than the original script.

**Passing QA means "I tried hard to find problems and couldn't" — not "I ran some checks and they passed."**

The code-reviewer applies five skeptical lenses (Counterfactual, Semantic, Boundary, Absence, Downstream) to every script and hunts for "sleeping bugs" — errors latent in the logic that don't manifest with current data but could with different inputs. See `.omp/agents/code-reviewer.md` § Review Mindset for the full framework.

## QA Checkpoint Overview

| Checkpoint | Stage | Focus | Triggers BLOCKER When |
|------------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| **QA1** | After fetch (Stage 5) | Raw data quality | Schema wrong, years missing, unexpected geography |
| **QA2** | After clean (Stage 6) | Cleaning correctness | Coded values remain, wrong suppression calc |
| **QA3** | After transform (Stage 7) | Transform validity | Wrong join type, aggregation error, data loss |
| **QA4a** | After analysis & viz (Stage 8) | Statistical validity | Wrong data source, incorrect aggregations, model non-convergence, scale misrepresentation |
| **QA4b** | After analysis & viz (Stage 8) | Visualization quality | Missing figures, labeling errors, accessibility issues, misleading scales |

---

## QA1: Post-Fetch Quality Assessment

**Applies To:** Stage 5 scripts (data retrieval)

**Purpose:** Verify raw data is correct for the analysis, not just that it was fetched successfully.

### Default Checks

| Check | What It Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Schema match | Columns match Plan specification | Critical columns missing |
| Year coverage | Years match Plan's year range | Target years absent |
| Geographic scope | Correct entity granularity per domain config (e.g., state/district/school for education) | Wrong geographic unit or entity level |
| ID uniqueness | Primary keys are unique | Duplicate IDs present |
| Dataset completeness | Expected rows and fields present | Partial data fetch |

### QA1 Standard Check Script (cr1)

```python
import polars as pl

# --- QA1: Post-Fetch Quality Assessment ---
print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("QA1: POST-FETCH QUALITY ASSESSMENT")
print("=" * 60)

qa1_max_severity = "PASSED"  # Track highest severity: PASSED < WARNING < BLOCKER

# Schema validation
expected_cols = plan_spec["expected_columns"]
missing = [c for c in expected_cols if c not in df.columns]
if missing:
    critical_missing = [c for c in missing if c in plan_spec["critical_columns"]]
    if critical_missing:
        print(f"[BLOCKER] Missing critical columns: {critical_missing}")
        qa1_max_severity = "BLOCKER"
    else:
        print(f"[WARNING] Missing non-critical columns: {missing}")
        qa1_max_severity = max(qa1_max_severity, "WARNING", key=["PASSED", "WARNING", "BLOCKER"].index)
else:
    print(f"[PASS] All {len(expected_cols)} expected columns present")

# Year coverage
year_col = plan_spec.get("year_col", "year")  # From Plan Domain Configuration
if year_col and year_col in df.columns:
    years_present = set(df[year_col].unique().to_list())
    years_expected = set(plan_spec["year_range"])
    missing_years = years_expected - years_present
    if missing_years:
        severity = "BLOCKER" if len(missing_years) > len(years_expected) // 2 else "WARNING"
        print(f"[{severity}] Missing years: {sorted(missing_years)}")
        qa1_max_severity = max(qa1_max_severity, severity, key=["PASSED", "WARNING", "BLOCKER"].index)
    else:
        print(f"[PASS] All expected years present: {sorted(years_present)}")

# ID uniqueness
id_col = plan_spec.get("primary_key")
if id_col and id_col in df.columns:
    duplicates = df.group_by(id_col).count().filter(pl.col("count") > 1)
    if len(duplicates) > 0:
        print(f"[BLOCKER] {len(duplicates)} duplicate IDs found in '{id_col}'")
        qa1_max_severity = "BLOCKER"
    else:
        print(f"[PASS] All IDs unique in '{id_col}'")

# --- Data Profiling (for qa2+ decision) ---
print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("DATA PROFILING")
print("=" * 60)
print(f"\nFirst 10 rows:\n{df.head(10)}")
print(f"\nDescriptive statistics:\n{df.describe()}")

print(f"\nQA1 RESULT: {qa1_max_severity}")
print("=" * 60)
```

### QA1 Discretionary Checks

Add when appropriate:

| Check | When to Add | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Value range | Numeric analysis | Values within expected bounds |
| Category coverage | Categorical analysis | All expected categories present |
| Cross-source consistency | Multi-source fetch | Same entities across sources |
| **Concrete trace** | **Always (at minimum 5)** — see `.omp/agents/code-reviewer.md` § Five Lenses of Skeptical Review | **Pick one entity (e.g., a specific school or state) and verify its record looks plausible** |

**Creative check prompt:** Before writing your QA1 script, ask: *"If the data access mirror returned data for the wrong geography or wrong year range, how would I detect that from the data alone?"* Design at least one check to answer that question.

### QA1 Iterative Investigation Triggers

Observations from qa1 that should trigger qa2+ investigation:

| qa1 Observation | Suggested qa2 Investigation |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Unexpected geography in data (states not in Plan scope) | Filter analysis: are extra states contaminating results? |
| Year distribution uneven (some years have 10x more records) | Investigate: data access issue or genuine enrollment change? |
| ID column has unexpected format variations | Trace: will downstream joins fail on format mismatch? |
| Row count far from Plan estimate (even if within tolerance) | Profile: what population is unexpectedly included/excluded? |

---

## QA2: Post-Clean Quality Assessment

**Applies To:** Stage 6 scripts (context application)

**Purpose:** Verify cleaning was done correctly, not just that cleaning operations ran.

### Default Checks

| Check | What It Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Coded values gone | Domain-specific coded values filtered properly (e.g., -1, -2, -3 for education) | Coded values remain in analysis columns |
| Suppression calc | Rate calculated correctly | Suppression rate miscalculated |
| Filter correctness | Correct rows removed | Wrong filter criteria applied |
| Type consistency | Data types are appropriate | Analysis columns have wrong types |

### QA2 Standard Check Script (cr1)

    for code in coded_missing_values:
        count = (df[col] == code).sum()
        if count > 0:
            print(f"[BLOCKER] Column '{col}' still has {count} coded value {code}")
            qa2_max_severity = "BLOCKER"

        raw_count = len(raw_df)
        clean_count = len(df)
        actual_rate = 1 - (clean_count / raw_count) if raw_count > 0 else 0
        reported_rate = plan_spec.get("reported_suppression_rate", {}).get(col)
        if reported_rate and abs(actual_rate - reported_rate) > 0.05:
            print(f"[WARNING] Suppression rate mismatch for '{col}': reported {reported_rate:.1%}, actual {actual_rate:.1%}")

```

### QA2 Discretionary Checks

| Check | When to Add | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Distribution comparison | Statistical analysis | Pre/post distributions similar |
| Outlier retention | Outlier-sensitive analysis | Correct outlier handling |
| Null pattern | Complex null logic | Nulls handled per specification |
| **Complement inspection** | **Always (at minimum 5)** — see `.omp/agents/code-reviewer.md` § Five Lenses of Skeptical Review | **Examine what was REMOVED by cleaning — do the removed rows look like what you'd expect?** |

**Creative check prompt:** Before writing your QA2 script, ask: *"If the cleaning logic had an off-by-one error in the filter condition (e.g., `>= -1` instead of `== -1`), what would the symptom look like in the cleaned data?"* Design at least one check to catch that class of error.

### QA2 Iterative Investigation Triggers

Observations from qa1 that should trigger qa2+ investigation:

| qa1 Observation | Suggested qa2 Investigation |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Coded value removal affected >20% of rows for a column | Profile removed rows: is a specific subgroup disproportionately affected? |
| Suppression rate varies widely across states | Investigate: does suppression pattern correlate with state reporting practices? |
| Type casting changed value distributions | Verify: are boundary values (min/max) preserved correctly after cast? |
| Null pattern is non-random (clustered by year or state) | Analyze: could missing data pattern bias the analysis conclusions? |

---

## QA3: Post-Transform Quality Assessment

**Applies To:** Stage 7 scripts (EDA and transformation)

**Purpose:** Verify transformations produced correct results, not just that they executed.

### Default Checks

| Check | What It Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Join cardinality | Expected 1:1, 1:many, many:1 | Unexpected fan-out or data loss |
| Aggregation correctness | Sums, means, counts correct | Aggregation logic error |
| Row preservation | Expected row change | >90% unexpected data loss |
| Column creation | New columns calculated correctly | Derived columns have wrong values |
| No surprise nulls | Expected nulls only | Unexpected nulls introduced |

### QA3 Discretionary Checks

| Check | When to Add | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Statistical tests | Distribution-critical | K-S test for distribution preservation |
| Business logic | Complex derivations | Derived values match business rules |
| Cross-validation | Multiple sources | Results consistent across methods |
| Temporal consistency | Time-series | No impossible date sequences |
| **Concrete trace** | **Always (at minimum 5)** — see `.omp/agents/code-reviewer.md` § Five Lenses of Skeptical Review | **Pick one entity and verify its journey through the transformation end-to-end** |

**Creative check prompt:** Before writing your QA3 script, ask: *"If this transformation had a subtle bug that affected 5% of records, what would the symptom look like in the output data? How would I detect it?"* Design at least one check to answer that question.

### QA3 Iterative Investigation Triggers

Observations from qa1 that should trigger qa2+ investigation:

| qa1 Observation | Suggested qa2 Investigation |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Join match rate < 80% | Profile non-matching keys: is there a systematic pattern (state, year, school type)? |
| Aggregation changed distribution shape significantly | Verify: are outlier groups driving the change? Is the aggregation logic correct? |
| Derived column has unexpected null rate | Trace: which input columns contribute nulls? Is the derivation formula correct? |
| Row count after transformation differs >10% from Plan estimate | Investigate: which filter or join step caused the unexpected change? |

## QA4a: Post-Analysis Statistical Validity

**Applies To:** Stage 8 scripts (statistical analysis and visualization)

**Purpose:** Verify data is represented accurately, statistical analyses are correct, and no misrepresentation occurs.

### Default Checks

| Check | What It Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Data source accuracy | Correct dataset used | Figure/analysis uses wrong data file |
| Aggregation correctness | Calculations match script logic | Aggregated values don't match source data |

| Assumption validation | Model assumptions checked (if applicable) | Critical assumptions violated without discussion |
| Coefficient reasonableness | Effect sizes plausible (if applicable) | Coefficients contradict domain knowledge |
| Robustness consistency | Alternative specs agree (if applicable) | Primary result reverses in robustness check |

### QA4a Discretionary Checks

| Check | When to Add | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Effect size plausibility | Regression/causal analysis | Estimated effects within domain-reasonable bounds |
| Sample size adequacy | Statistical tests | Sufficient N for claimed significance |
| Multiple comparison adjustment | Multiple hypotheses tested | p-values adjusted appropriately |
| Outlier influence | Regression analysis | Results not driven by a few extreme observations |
| **Concrete trace** | **Always (at minimum 5)** — see `.omp/agents/code-reviewer.md` § Five Lenses of Skeptical Review | **Pick one data point and verify its representation in the analysis output is accurate** |

**Creative check prompt:** Before writing your QA4a script, ask: *"If the script used the wrong column for a key calculation, or aggregated at the wrong level, how would the output differ from correct output?"* Design at least one check to catch that class of error.

### QA4a Iterative Investigation Triggers

Observations from cra1 that should trigger cra2+ investigation:

| cra1 Observation | Suggested cra2 Investigation |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Aggregated totals don't match source data sums | Trace: which group(s) account for the discrepancy? Is a filter being applied incorrectly? |
| Model coefficients have unexpected signs | Investigate: is there multicollinearity, omitted variable bias, or data coding error? |
| Effect sizes implausibly large or small | Profile: are outliers driving the result? Does winsorization change the conclusion? |
| Robustness check shows marginal consistency | Deeper analysis: how sensitive is the result to specification choices? |

## QA4b: Post-Analysis Visualization Quality

**Applies To:** Stage 8 scripts (visualization)

**Purpose:** Verify visualizations are complete, labeled, accessible, visually coherent, and publication-ready.

### Default Checks

| Check | What It Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| File existence | All planned figures created | Required figures missing |
| File size | Figures have content | File size < 10KB (likely empty) |
| Title/labels | All axes labeled with units, descriptive title | Missing titles or axis labels |
| Colorblind-safe palette | Accessible color scheme used | Color-only encoding without texture/shape |
| COVID period annotation | Years 2020-2022 flagged visually (if present) | COVID years present but not annotated |
| Legend clarity | Legend present if needed, labels interpretable | Legend missing when required |
| Resolution | Exported at appropriate DPI | DPI <150 for print-intended figures |
| Misleading scales | Y-axis starts at 0 for bar charts | Truncated axis distorts interpretation |

### QA4b Discretionary Checks

| Check | When to Add | What It Validates |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Aspect ratio | Publication submission | Figure dimensions meet requirements |
| Font size | Presentation figures | Text readable at intended display size |
| Annotation accuracy | Annotated plots | Annotation text matches data values |
| Multi-panel consistency | Faceted plots | Consistent scales across panels |
| **Visual trace** | **Always (at minimum 5)** — see `.omp/agents/code-reviewer.md` § Five Lenses of Skeptical Review | **Use the read tool to visually inspect each generated PNG file.** Additionally, pick one data point and verify programmatically that it appears in the correct position in the figure |

**Creative check prompt:** Before writing your QA4b script, ask: *"If a figure were missing its legend, had truncated axes, or used a color scheme indistinguishable to colorblind readers, how would I detect that programmatically and visually (via the **read tool** on the PNG output)?"* Design at least one check to catch that class of error.

### QA4b Iterative Investigation Triggers

Observations from crb1 that should trigger crb2+ investigation:

| crb1 Observation | Suggested crb2 Investigation |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Figure file size varies wildly across expected figures | Investigate: are some figures blank or truncated? |
| Script has no explicit DPI or size settings | Verify: do output figures meet minimum resolution? |
| Color palette not from known accessible set | Test: verify redundant encoding (shape/linetype) present |
| COVID years in data but annotation only on some figures | Audit: which figures include COVID years and which lack annotation? |

## Severity Classification Rules

### BLOCKER (Revision Required)

A finding is BLOCKER severity when:

1. **Data Correctness Compromised**
   - Wrong data is being used (wrong years, wrong geography, wrong columns)
   - Transformations produce incorrect results
   - Joins have unexpected cardinality

2. **Methodology Violated**
   - Implementation contradicts Plan specification
   - Critical cleaning steps skipped or wrong
   - Business logic errors in calculations

3. **Validation Inadequate**
   - Code could pass despite data corruption
   - Critical checks missing entirely
   - STOP conditions not implemented

4. **Output Invalid**
   - Missing required outputs
   - Outputs contain clearly wrong data
   - Stub/placeholder code detected

### WARNING (Document and Proceed)

A finding is WARNING severity when:

1. **Quality Concern (Not Correctness)**
   - Suboptimal approach that still works
   - Edge cases not explicitly handled (but unlikely)
   - Validation could be more robust

2. **Minor Deviation**
   - Slight methodology variation (acceptable)
   - Row counts differ from expectation (within tolerance)
   - Performance could be improved

3. **Documentation Gap (IAT Compliance)**
   - Missing INTENT comments on transformations
   - Missing REASONING comments on non-obvious choices
   - Assumptions not explicitly stated (missing ASSUMES comments)
   - Section preambles absent
   - Magic numbers without explanation
   - See `agent_reference/INLINE_AUDIT_TRAIL.md` for the full standard

### INFO (Log Only)

A finding is INFO severity when:

1. **Suggestions for Improvement**
   - Code could be cleaner
   - Better approaches exist
   - Optimization opportunities

2. **Observations**
   - Interesting data patterns
   - Potential future enhancements
   - Style preferences

### Naming Convention

**Standard pattern (Stages 5-7):** `stage{N}_{step:02d}_cr{iteration}.py`

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `stage{N}` | Stage number (5, 6, 7) | `stage7` |
| `{step}` | Step number from reviewed script | `01`, `02` |
| `_cr{iteration}` | QA script suffix with iteration number (1-5) | `_cr1`, `_cr2` |

**Stage 8 pattern (split QA):** `stage8_{step:02d}_cr{a|b}{iteration}.py`

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `stage8` | Stage 8 (analysis & visualization) | `stage8` |
| `{step}` | Step number from reviewed script | `01`, `02` |
| `_cra{iteration}` | QA4a (statistical validity) suffix | `_cra1`, `_cra2` |
| `_crb{iteration}` | QA4b (visualization quality) suffix | `_crb1`, `_crb2` |

**Examples:**
- Script `01_fetch-ccd.py` in Stage 5 → `stage5_01_cr1.py` (first iteration), `stage5_01_cr2.py` (if needed)
- Script `02_aggregate.py` in Stage 7 → `stage7_02_cr1.py`
- Script `01_regression-analysis.py` in Stage 8 → `stage8_01_cra1.py` (QA4a), `stage8_01_crb1.py` (QA4b)

**Data Onboarding profiling QA naming:** For the profiling QA naming convention (`profile_{phase}_cr{N}.py`), see `.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/references/data-onboarding-mode.md` and the QAP Script Naming Convention section within this document.

## QA Report Format

QA checkpoint results follow this conceptual schema. The actual output to the orchestrator uses Markdown format (see the code-reviewer invocation template in `full-pipeline-mode.md`). This YAML schema documents the logical structure:

```yaml
qa_report:
  script_reviewed: "scripts/stage7_transform/01_join-data.py"
  qa_script: "scripts/cr/stage7_01_cr1.py"
  status: "ISSUES_FOUND"  # or "PASSED"
  severity: "BLOCKER"      # highest severity found

  checks:
    - name: "join_cardinality"
      status: "FAIL"
      severity: "BLOCKER"
      message: "Expected 1:1 join but got fan-out"
      evidence: "Output has 150,000 rows from 100,000 source rows"

    - name: "schema_match"
      status: "PASS"
      severity: null
      message: "All expected columns present"

    - name: "distribution"
      status: "WARN"
      severity: "WARNING"
      message: "Enrollment distribution shifted after join"
      evidence: "Pre-join mean: 450, post-join mean: 380"

  issues:
    blockers:
      - check: "join_cardinality"
        description: "Fan-out detected in 1:1 join"
        suggested_fix: "Check for duplicate keys in right table"

    warnings:
      - check: "distribution"
        description: "Distribution shifted unexpectedly"
        recommendation: "Verify join key matching is correct"

    info: []

  recommendation: "REVISION_REQUIRED"  # or "PROCEED" or "ESCALATE"
```

Stage 10 aggregates all QA findings from Stages 5-8:

### QA Summary for Stage 10

```markdown
## QA Summary Report

### Execution Overview
| Stage | Scripts | QA Reviews | BLOCKERs Found | BLOCKERs Resolved |

## QA Checkpoint STOP Conditions

QA checkpoints can trigger STOP conditions that prevent proceeding:

| Condition | Checkpoint | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| BLOCKER after 2 revision scripts (_a.py, _b.py) | Any | STOP, escalate to user |
| Methodology violation | Any | STOP, escalate immediately |
| Data corruption detected | QA3 | STOP, invoke debugger |
| Statistical misrepresentation detected | QA4a | STOP, revision required |
| Missing critical figures | QA4b | STOP, revision required |
| QA script execution fails | Any | STOP, investigate |

## Profiling QA Checkpoints (QAP1-QAP4)

> **Mode:** These checkpoints apply to Data Onboarding Mode only. They are the profiling equivalent of QA1-QA4b. See `.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/references/data-onboarding-mode.md` for complete profiling protocol details.

### QAP Overview

| Checkpoint | Part | Focus | BLOCKER When |
|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| QAP1 | A (Structural) | Load fidelity, schema accuracy | Wrong delimiter/encoding, type inference errors, row/column count mismatch |
| QAP2 | B (Statistical) | Statistical characterization | Distribution claims wrong, temporal breaks missed, coverage gaps undetected |
| QAP3 | C (Relational) | Relationship discovery | Key uniqueness misidentified, dependencies missed, anomalies uncatalogued |
| QAP4 | D (Interpretation) | Semantic accuracy | Interpretations stated as facts (missing [PRELIMINARY]), reconciliation gaps |

### QAP1: Post-Structural (Part A)

**Trigger:** After scripts 01-03 complete and CPP1 passes.

**Default Checks:**
| Check | Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Re-load verification | Load with alternative parameters produces same data | Row/column counts differ across methods |
| Sample row spot-check | Random rows match raw file inspection | Values corrupted or truncated |
| Encoding verification | No mojibake or replacement characters | Non-ASCII characters corrupted |
| Schema stability | Re-running type inference produces same types | Types change between runs |
| Column coverage | Every column appears in profile output | Any column missing from profile |

### QAP2: Post-Statistical (Part B)

**Trigger:** After scripts 04-06 (conditional) complete and CPP2 passes.

**Default Checks:**
| Check | Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Independent stat verification | Recompute mean/median for random columns | Independently computed stat differs |
| Distribution label accuracy | Distribution claims pass appropriate tests | "Normal" claim fails normality test at p < 0.01 |
| Outlier boundary reasonableness | IQR fences are sensible | Fences exclude >20% of data without explanation |
| Temporal break detection | Obvious structural breaks are flagged | Dramatic year-to-year changes missed |
| Coverage completeness | Entity/geographic coverage is assessed | Known universe not checked when identifiers present |

### QAP3: Post-Relational (Part C)

**Trigger:** After scripts 07-09 (conditional) complete and CPP3 passes.

**Default Checks:**
| Check | Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Key uniqueness counter-check | Claimed keys tested independently | Claimed unique key has duplicates |
| Dependency verification | Functional dependencies are real | Counter-examples exist for claimed A->B dependency |
| Anomaly catalog completeness | All major anomalies found | Known pattern (duplicates, coded values) present but uncatalogued |
| Cross-column consistency | Consistency rules are complete | Obvious logical constraint violated but not flagged |
| Coded value scan completeness | Standard sentinels checked | Numeric columns not scanned for -1, -2, -3, -9, -99, -999 |

### QAP4: Post-Interpretation (Part D)

**Trigger:** After scripts 10-11 (conditional) complete and CPP4 passes.

**Default Checks:**
| Check | Validates | BLOCKER If |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| PRELIMINARY marking | All interpretations hedged | Any interpretation stated as fact without [PRELIMINARY] marker |
| Documentation coverage | All documented claims checked against data | Documented column present but not reconciled |
| Discrepancy evidence | Every discrepancy has actual-vs-documented values | Discrepancy noted without showing evidence |
| Interpretation completeness | All columns with non-trivial semantics have an interpretation entry | Column with identifiable meaning has no interpretation |

### QAP Severity Classification

Profiling QA uses the same severity levels as analysis QA:
- **BLOCKER:** Data characterization is incorrect, profiling methodology violated, or output is unreliable
- **WARNING:** Quality concern or minor gap that should be documented but does not block progression
- **INFO:** Suggestion or observation for improvement

### QAP Script Naming Convention

```
scripts/cr/
  profile_structural_cr{N}.py     # QAP1 review scripts
  profile_statistical_cr{N}.py    # QAP2 review scripts
  profile_relational_cr{N}.py     # QAP3 review scripts
  profile_interpretation_cr{N}.py # QAP4 review scripts
```

## Anti-Patterns

**DO NOT skip QA for "simple" scripts.** Even simple fetch or filter operations can produce surprising results. Every Stage 5-8 script gets a QA checkpoint.

**DO NOT conflate CP and QA failures.** A script can pass CP3 but fail QA3 if the validation was inadequate. QA catches what CP misses.

**DO NOT create QA-of-QA loops.** QA scripts themselves don't need secondary review. If a QA script fails, debug the QA script or the original script, not both recursively.

**DO NOT treat all BLOCKERs the same.** Methodology BLOCKERs escalate immediately. Technical BLOCKERs get revision attempts.

**DO NOT proceed with unresolved BLOCKERs.** The entire point of QA is to catch issues early. Proceeding with known BLOCKERs defeats the purpose.

**DO NOT write QA scripts that only re-run the original script's checks.** QA value comes from orthogonal validation — checking from a different angle. If your QA script duplicates the original's checks with no additions, you've added audit trail but not safety.

**DO NOT issue PASSED without articulating WHY.** "All checks passed" is not a QA finding — it's an absence of findings. A proper PASSED includes reasoning: what you looked for, what alternative failure modes you considered, and why you're confident the code is correct.

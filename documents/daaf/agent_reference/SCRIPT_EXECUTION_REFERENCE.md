# Script Execution Reference

This document is the **single source of truth** for how Python scripts are written, executed, captured, versioned, and managed in DAAF. It covers both the file-first execution protocol and the standardized script format templates.

Every agent that writes or executes Python code (research-executor, code-reviewer, debugger, notebook-assembler) follows this reference.

**Documentation Standard:** All scripts follow the Inline Audit Trail (IAT) protocol. See `agent_reference/INLINE_AUDIT_TRAIL.md` for the complete standard.

---

# Part 1: File-First Execution Protocol

## Overview

**Why this protocol exists:** Scripts are the primary execution artifacts — not notebooks, not interactive sessions. Each script is a self-contained, reproducible unit with an embedded execution log that proves exactly what code ran and what it produced. This gives every analysis a complete audit trail: code + output + version history.

**The philosophy:** Write first. Execute once. Capture everything. Never modify, only version.

---

## The Protocol

Every Python execution follows these steps in order. No exceptions.

```
WRITE  -->  EXECUTE  -->  CAPTURE  -->  COMMIT
            (if failed: VERSION the script, then REPEAT from WRITE)
```

### Step 1: Write the Script to a File

Create the script file BEFORE executing any code. Use the standard template format from Part 2 of this document.

- Save to the appropriate stage directory (see Directory Structure below)
- Include: shebang, metadata docstring, config section, sequential code, inline validation
- Follow IAT documentation standards (see `agent_reference/INLINE_AUDIT_TRAIL.md`)
- Scripts are **flat, sequential** Python — no `def main()`, no `if __name__` guards, no helper function sections

### Step 2: Execute with the Wrapper

Run the script using the execution wrapper, which handles output capture and log appending automatically:

```bash
bash {BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step}_{task-name}.py
```

**Single command only.** Do not chain with `&&` or `;`. Do not prefix with `cd`. Use absolute paths.

**Do NOT run `python script.py` directly.** Direct execution bypasses output capture and log appending.

### Step 3: Capture is Automatic

The wrapper automatically:
1. Executes the script and captures all stdout/stderr
2. Records timestamp, duration, and exit code
3. Appends the complete execution log to the script file as comments
4. Returns the script's exit code

After execution, the script file itself contains both the code AND proof of what happened when it ran.

### Step 4: If Failed, Create a Versioned Copy

If the script fails (non-zero exit code or failed validation):

1. The original script already has its failed output appended — leave it as-is
2. Create a new versioned copy: `cp {step}_{task-name}.py {step}_{task-name}_a.py`
3. Apply fixes to the new copy only
4. Execute the new copy with `run_with_capture.sh`
5. If it fails again, create `_b.py`, then `_c.py`, etc.

**Never modify a script after its execution log has been appended.** See Script Versioning below for complete suffix conventions, examples, and rules.

### Step 5: Commit

After successful execution:
1. Commit the script (two separate Bash calls):
   - `git add scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step}_{task-name}.py`
   - `git commit -m "feat(stage{N}-{step}): {brief description}"`
2. Proceed to next step in the Transformation Sequence

If the script went through versioned revisions (Step 4), commit **all** versions for audit trail completeness.

---

## Execution Wrapper

### Location and Setup

The canonical wrapper lives at the **repo root**: `{BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh` (i.e., `/daaf/scripts/run_with_capture.sh`).

All scripts reference this single canonical copy directly — there is no need to copy it into individual project directories. This avoids drift and ensures every project uses the same version.

**Executable permission required:** `run_with_capture.sh` must have its executable bit set both on the filesystem (`chmod +x`) and in Git's index (`git update-index --chmod=+x`). The file's mode in `git ls-files -s` must be `100755`. Without this, `./run_with_capture.sh` invocations will fail, and clones of the repository will receive a non-executable copy. The same requirement applies to `collect_session_logs.sh` and any other `.sh` utility in `scripts/`.

### What It Does

1. Validates the script path exists
2. Checks whether the script already has an execution log (blocks re-runs if so)
3. Executes `python <script>` with stdout/stderr capture via `tee`
4. Records timestamp, duration, and exit code
5. Appends the complete execution log to the script file as comments
6. Returns the script's exit code

### Usage

```bash
# Execute a script (single Bash call, absolute paths)
bash {BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/stage5_fetch/01_fetch-ccd.py

# If it fails, create a versioned copy and fix
cp {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/stage5_fetch/01_fetch-ccd.py {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/stage5_fetch/01_fetch-ccd_a.py
# Edit 01_fetch-ccd_a.py with fixes, then execute the new version
bash {BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/stage5_fetch/01_fetch-ccd_a.py
```

### Re-run Protection

The wrapper checks for the marker `# EXECUTION LOG` in the script file. If found, it **refuses to run** and prints guidance to create a versioned copy instead. This enforces the versioning rule: once a script has been executed, it is a historical record.

---

## Script Versioning

### Rules

1. **Never modify a script after its execution log has been appended.** The log documents that exact code's behavior. Modifying it destroys the audit trail.
2. **Always create a new versioned copy for fixes.** The original (with its failed output) is preserved as evidence of what was tried.
3. **Preserve all versions.** Failed attempts are part of the audit trail. They document what was tried and why it failed.
4. **Only the final successful version is used downstream.** The notebook-assembler (Stage 9) uses the last passing version. QA reviews the final version.

### Suffix Convention

| Attempt | Suffix | Filename Example |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| First (original) | _(none)_ | `01_join-ccd-meps.py` |
| Second | `_a` | `01_join-ccd-meps_a.py` |
| Third | `_b` | `01_join-ccd-meps_b.py` |
| Fourth | `_c` | `01_join-ccd-meps_c.py` |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Twenty-seventh | `_aa` | `01_join-ccd-meps_aa.py` |

### Example Progression

```
scripts/stage7_transform/
  01_join-ccd-meps.py       # v1: FAILED (key mismatch) - output appended showing 0 rows
  01_join-ccd-meps_a.py     # v2: FAILED (type error) - output appended showing cast error
  01_join-ccd-meps_b.py     # v3: PASSED - output appended showing CP3 PASSED
```

After this progression:
- All three files are preserved (audit trail)
- `01_join-ccd-meps_b.py` is the **final successful version** used by downstream stages
- Anyone reviewing the history can see exactly what went wrong and how it was fixed

### QA-Triggered Revisions

If code-reviewer returns a BLOCKER after the script's primary checkpoint passed, the revision continues from the current suffix:

```
01_join-data.py       # v1: CP3 PASSED, but QA finds wrong join type --> BLOCKER
01_join-data_a.py     # v2: Fixed join type, CP3 PASSED, QA PASSED
```

Maximum 2 revision attempts per QA BLOCKER. If still failing after 2 revisions, escalate to the user.

---

## Returning Output to the Orchestrator

**Execution logs are captured in the script file. Agents returning output to the orchestrator should SUMMARIZE checkpoint results (PASSED/FAILED/WARNING + 1-line reason), not echo the raw log.**

The `run_with_capture.sh` wrapper appends the complete execution log to the script file as comments. This means the full audit trail is *already preserved on disk*. When an agent (research-executor, code-reviewer, debugger) finishes its work and returns a Task result to the orchestrator:

- **Report outcomes, not process:** "CP1 PASSED: 2,528 rows, 12 columns, 0.3% missingness" — not the full stdout.
- **Reference files by path, don't reproduce contents:** The orchestrator can read any file if it needs detail.
- **Keep verification tables to results only:** PASS/FAIL per check with a short note, not the underlying data that proved it.
- **Summarize, don't echo:** If the execution log shows 50 lines of data profiling output, the agent returns "Distributions reasonable, no outliers detected" — not the 50 lines.

This separation — exhaustive in the files, concise in the message — is what keeps the orchestrator's context viable across a full pipeline.

---

## Critical Rules

### Inviolable (NEVER)

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **NEVER execute Python interactively before writing to a file** | Scripts are the primary artifact. Interactive execution bypasses the audit trail. |
| **NEVER modify a script after appending its execution log** | The log documents that exact code. Modifications make the log misleading. |
| **NEVER run `python script.py` directly** | Use `run_with_capture.sh` so output is captured and appended automatically. |
| **NEVER delete failed script versions** | All versions form the audit trail. They document what was tried and what failed. |
| **NEVER use function definitions (`def main()`, helpers)** | Sequential scripts read top-to-bottom. Functions add indirection without reuse value. |

### Required Practices (ALWAYS)

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **ALWAYS create a new versioned copy for fixes** | Preserves the full history of attempts and outputs. |
| **ALWAYS use the wrapper for execution** | It handles capture, timing, log appending, and re-run protection. |
| **ALWAYS use the final successful version downstream** | Notebook and report reference only the version that passed. |
| **ALWAYS follow one-operation-per-script** | Mixing multiple transformations hides the source of errors. |
| **ALWAYS commit all versions** | Audit trail shows evolution of code and results. |
| **ALWAYS include shebang, metadata docstring, and config section** | Required for traceability and reproducibility. |
| **ALWAYS use `Path` with `PROJECT_DIR` constant** | Hardcoded paths break when project location changes. |
| **ALWAYS capture pre/post state around transformations** | Enables validation of row count changes and data integrity. |
| **ALWAYS include checkpoint validation (`assert` + `print`)** | Every transformation needs inline proof of correctness. |
| **ALWAYS follow IAT protocol (INTENT, REASONING, ASSUMES)** | Uncommented transformations block QA review. See `INLINE_AUDIT_TRAIL.md`. |

# Part 2: Script Format and Templates

Part 1 defined **what to do** (the execution lifecycle). Part 2 defines **what the files look like** — the directory layout, naming conventions, and complete script templates for each stage. Use this as a reference when writing new scripts.

```

**Data Onboarding profiling scripts** follow a parallel directory convention under `scripts/`:
- `profile_structural/` (Part A, scripts 01-03)
- `profile_statistical/` (Part B, scripts 04-06)
- `profile_relational/` (Part C, scripts 07-09)
- `profile_interpretation/` (Part D, scripts 10-11)

Profiling scripts use the same file-first execution pattern, IAT documentation standards, and `run_with_capture.sh` wrapper. See `.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/references/data-onboarding-mode.md` for the profiling script template and part-specific details.

**Everything stays inside the project.** All script outputs, intermediates, and scratch files are written under the project directory — never `/tmp`, which is outside the backup and audit boundary and is blocked by the `bash-safety.sh` extension and `config.yml` deny rules. Temporary/intermediate working files go in `{PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/scratch/` (created on first use); see AGENTS.md § Project Conventions > Scratch Files. (Reading DAAF's own `/tmp` coordination caches, e.g. `/tmp/claude-model-*`, is permitted — only writes to `/tmp` are blocked.)

---

## Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `{step:02d}_{task-name}.py`

| Component | Source | Format |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `step` | Step number from Transformation Sequence (e.g., 1.1, 2.3) | 2-digit zero-padded (01, 02) |
| `task-name` | Task Name from Transformation Sequence | lowercase-with-hyphens |

**Examples:**
- Step 1.1 `fetch-ccd` → `01_fetch-ccd.py`
- Step 2.3 `join-ccd-meps` → `03_join-ccd-meps.py`
- Debug issue `key-mismatch` → `01_diag-key-mismatch.py`

### QA Script Naming Convention (Iterative)

**Pattern:** `stage{N}_{step:02d}_cr{iteration}.py`

| Component | Source | Format |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `stage{N}` | Stage number (5, 6, 7, 8) | single digit (Stage 8 uses `cra`/`crb` — see below) |
| `step` | Step number of the reviewed script | 2-digit zero-padded |
| `_cr{iteration}` | QA script suffix with iteration (1-5) | `_cr1`, `_cr2`, etc. |

**Examples:**
- QA for `01_fetch-ccd.py` (Stage 5) → `stage5_01_cr1.py` (first iteration), `stage5_01_cr2.py` (if needed)
- QA for `02_join-data.py` (Stage 7) → `stage7_02_cr1.py`
- QA for `02_enrollment-plot.py` (Stage 8 viz) → `stage8_02_crb1.py`

**Stage 8 QA Split:** Stage 8 uses separate QA prefixes for analysis (QA4a) and visualization (QA4b):
- QA4a for `01_regression-poverty.py` (Stage 8.1 analysis) → `stage8_01_cra1.py`
- QA4b for `02_enrollment-plot.py` (Stage 8.2 viz) → `stage8_02_crb1.py`

**QA scripts are created by code-reviewer** and saved in `scripts/cr/`.

### Debug Script Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `{seq:02d}_diag-{slug}.py`

**Example:** `01_diag-key-mismatch.py`

All debug scripts are saved in `scripts/debug/`.

---

## Standard Script Template

Every script is a **flat, sequential** Python file that reads top-to-bottom like a lab notebook. There are no `main()` functions, no helper function sections, and no `if __name__` guards. The script runs from top to bottom when executed with `python script.py`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""

Wave: {wave}, Step: {step}, Stage: {N}

assert all(c in result.columns for c in ["required_col"]), "STOP: Missing required columns"

## Execution Log Section

**This section is auto-appended** after the script is executed. It provides:

- **Timestamp:** When the script was run
- **Duration:** How long execution took
- **Exit code:** 0 = success, non-zero = failure
- **Full stdout:** All printed output including validation results
- **Any stderr:** Warnings or errors

**Example of appended execution log:**

After seeing this failure, create `01_join-ccd-meps_a.py` with fixes, run it, and it will get its own execution log.

## Stage 5: Mirror-Based Fetch (MANDATORY)

**Applies to:** All Stage 5 fetch scripts.

Stage 5 scripts download data from configured mirrors (per mirrors.yaml).

### Fetch Decision

| Dataset Type | Pattern | Reference |
|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Single-file (all years) | `fetch_from_mirrors()` | Domain query skill `./references/fetch-patterns.md` (e.g., `education-data-query`) |
| Yearly files | `fetch_yearly_from_mirrors()` | Domain query skill `./references/fetch-patterns.md` (e.g., `education-data-query`) |

### Mirror Fetch Code Pattern

```python
# --- Mirror Configuration ---
# INTENT: Download {dataset} from the fastest available mirror.
# REASONING: Mirrors loaded from mirrors.yaml (single source of truth).
# Format-specific read driven by each mirror's read_strategy field.
# All mirrors use the same canonical path from datasets-reference.md.
import yaml

# Education domain example — substitute your domain's query skill path
MIRRORS_YAML = Path("/daaf/.omp/skills/education-data-query/references/mirrors.yaml")

with open(MIRRORS_YAML) as f:
    MIRRORS = yaml.safe_load(f)["mirrors"]

# Dataset path: canonical path string from datasets-reference.md.
# All mirrors use the same path — only root_url and format differ.
DATASET_PATH = "ccd/schools_ccd_directory"  # Education domain example

# [Include fetch_from_mirrors(path, ...) function from fetch-patterns.md]

## QA Script Template

QA scripts are created by **code-reviewer** to validate outputs independently from the original execution script.

**Reference:** See `agent_reference/QA_CHECKPOINTS.md` for complete QA checkpoint definitions (QA1-QA4b) and stage-specific validation criteria.

### QA Script Structure

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
QA Inspection: Stage {N} Step {step}

Reviewed Script: scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step}_{task-name}.py
Output Files: {list of output files}
Plan Reference: {plan_path}

QA Checks:
1. Schema validation
2. Row count verification
3. Distribution sanity
4. Coded value absence
5. Critical null check

### QA Script Best Practices

| Practice | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Load data independently** | Don't trust the original script's data handling |
| **Use values from Plan** | Expected columns, row counts come from Plan specification |
| **Run default checks always** | Schema, rows, distribution, coded values, nulls |
| **Add discretionary checks** | Statistical tests, methodology checks when context warrants |
| **Exit non-zero on failure** | Use `raise SystemExit(1)` so the wrapper captures failure |
| **Save to scripts/cr/** | Keeps QA scripts separate from execution scripts |

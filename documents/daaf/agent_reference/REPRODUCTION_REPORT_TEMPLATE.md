# Reproduction Report Template

This template defines the central artifact for Reproducibility Verification mode. It serves three purposes simultaneously: (1) progress tracker during re-execution, (2) comparison log capturing all deviations, and (3) final deliverable summarizing reproducibility findings.

**Update discipline:** The orchestrator and its subagents update this report **iteratively and frequently** — after every script re-execution, not in batch. The report is the running record of truth for the reproduction attempt.

---

## Template

Copy this template to `Reproduction_Report.md` in the reproduction project folder at RV-1 setup.

```markdown
# Reproduction Report: [Original Project Title]

**Reproduction Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Original Analysis Date:** [original date prefix]
**Original Project:** `research/[original_folder]/`
**Reproduction Project:** `research/[reproduction_folder]/`

---

## Executive Summary

> **Written last, during RV-4 synthesis.** Do not fill in until all scripts have been re-executed and the report verification is complete.

**Overall Reproducibility Assessment:** [FULLY REPRODUCED / PARTIALLY REPRODUCED / NOT REPRODUCED]

**Scripts Re-executed:** [N] of [N]
**Scripts Reproduced Successfully:** [N] ([X]%)
**Scripts with Deviations:** [N]
**Scripts that Failed:** [N]
**Scripts Requiring Modifications:** [N]

**Summary of Findings:**
[3-5 sentences: What reproduced cleanly, what diverged and why, what failed and why. Written in plain language for a non-technical reviewer.]

**Summary of Methodological Concerns:**
[2-3 sentences: Key methodological observations surfaced during reproduction. These are concerns about the *analytical approach itself*, not about whether the code ran.]

---

## Methodological Concerns

> **Accumulated during RV-2** as the reproduction agent encounters each script. **Synthesized during RV-4.** Each concern is tagged with the script that prompted it and a severity assessment.

### Concern Severity Scale

| Severity | Meaning | Action Needed |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **CRITICAL** | May invalidate one or more findings | Requires investigation before results are trusted |
| **NOTABLE** | Could affect interpretation or generalizability | Should be disclosed in limitations |
| **MINOR** | Stylistic or best-practice observation | No action required; noted for completeness |

### Concerns Log

| # | Script | Severity | Concern | Detail |
|---|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | [script_name] | [CRITICAL/NOTABLE/MINOR] | [One-line concern title] | [Explanation: what was observed, why it matters, what the alternative approach would be] |

### Synthesis of Methodological Concerns

> **Written during RV-4.** Group related concerns, assess their collective impact on the analysis conclusions, and provide an overall methodological assessment.

[Narrative synthesis here]

---

## Reproduction Inventory

> **Populated during RV-1** from notebook decompilation. Updated with status during RV-2 as each script is re-executed.

### Source Artifacts

| Artifact | Location | Present |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Original Report | `original_files/[report_name]` | [Yes/No] |
| Original Notebook | `original_files/[notebook_name]` | [Yes/No] |
| Original Figures | `original_files/output/figures/` | [Yes/No] |
| Original Preliminary Notes | `original_files/output/preliminary_notes/` | [Yes/No/N/A] |
| Decompiled Scripts | `original_files/scripts/` | [Yes/No] |
| Decompilation Manifest | `original_files/scripts/MANIFEST.md` | [Yes/No] |
| Original Dockerfile | `original_files/Dockerfile.original` | [Yes/No/Unavailable] |
| RV-3 Verification Findings | `output/preliminary_notes/[date]_rv3_report-verification.md` | [Yes/No] |
| Reproduction Session Logs | `logs/` | [Yes/No] |

### Script Inventory

| # | Step | Script | Stage | Type | Original Output | Repro Status |
|---|------|--------|-------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | [step] | [script_name] | [5/6/7/8] | [fetch/clean/transform/analysis/viz] | [output_path] | [PENDING/REPRODUCED/DIVERGED/FAILED/MODIFIED] |

**Status Definitions:**
- **PENDING** — Not yet re-executed
- **REPRODUCED** — Re-execution produced matching output (within tolerance)
- **DIVERGED** — Re-execution completed but output differs from original
- **FAILED** — Re-execution produced an error; script did not complete
- **MODIFIED** — Script required changes to run; modifications documented below

### Scope Decisions

> **Confirmed at mode confirmation AND after RV-1 inventory.**

| Decision | User Choice | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Re-fetch data from mirrors? | [Yes / No — use existing data] | [Why] |
| Methodological review depth | [Light / Full] | [Why] |
| Scripts excluded from reproduction | [None / list with reasons] | [Why] |

### Infrastructure Normalizations

> **Applied during RV-1 setup** by running `normalize_project_dir.py` on all decompiled scripts in batch. Infrastructure normalizations are mechanical path/environment adjustments that make scripts executable in the reproduction project. They do not affect reproduction status — a script requiring only infrastructure normalizations retains REPRODUCED status. Paste the normalizer's Markdown table output below.

| File | Original Value | Normalized Value | Type |
|------|----------------|------------------|------|
| `stage5_fetch/01_fetch-data.py` | `PROJECT_DIR = Path("/daaf/research/original_project/")` | `PROJECT_DIR = Path("/daaf/research/reproduction_project/")` | PROJECT_DIR path |

### Comparison Standards

> **Reference tolerances for RV-2 output comparison.** Apply these when classifying deviations as substantive or cosmetic.

| Metric | Tolerance | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Row count | Exact match | 0 difference required |
| Column count | Exact match | 0 difference required |
| Float values | 1e-6 relative tolerance | Minor floating-point variance is expected |
| String values | Exact match | 0 difference required |
| Integer values | Exact match | 0 difference required |
| Timestamps in logs | Expected to differ | Cosmetic — do not flag |
| File paths in logs | Expected to differ | Cosmetic — do not flag |
| Figures | Visual inspection via read tool | Minor rendering differences (anti-aliasing, font rendering) are expected |

---

## Per-Script Reproduction Results

> **Updated incrementally during RV-2.** Each script gets its own section immediately after re-execution. Do NOT batch these — update the report after every single script.

### Script [#]: [script_name]

**Stage:** [5/6/7/8] | **Step:** [N.N] | **Type:** [fetch/clean/transform/analysis/viz]

#### Execution Comparison

| Metric | Original | Reproduced | Match? |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| Exit code | [0/1] | [0/1] | [Yes/No] |
| Output rows | [N] | [N] | [Yes/No] |
| Output columns | [N] | [N] | [Yes/No] |
| Schema match | — | — | [Yes/No] |
| Key statistics | [summary] | [summary] | [Yes/No/Within tolerance] |

#### Checkpoint Comparison

| Checkpoint | Original Result | Reproduced Result | Match? |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| [CP1/CP2/CP3/CP4] | [PASSED/FAILED + key metrics] | [PASSED/FAILED + key metrics] | [Yes/No] |

#### Deviations

> If status is REPRODUCED with no deviations, write "None — output matches original."

[Description of any differences observed. Include: what differs, magnitude of difference, likely cause (e.g., floating-point ordering, data source update, timestamp difference, random seed), and whether the deviation is substantive or cosmetic.]

#### Modifications Required

> If no modifications were needed, write "None — original script executed successfully."
> **If ANY modification was required, this must be prominently flagged.** Modifications undermine reproduction fidelity.

- **Modification type:** [Infrastructure / Substantive / None]
- **What was changed:** [exact description]
- **Why it was necessary:** [root cause]
- **Impact on output:** [whether the change could affect results]
- **Modified script location:** `scripts/repro/[script_name]`
- **Version suffix:** [_repro_a.py, etc.]

#### Methodological Notes

> Brief observations about the analytical approach in this script. Concerns with severity >= NOTABLE should also be added to the Methodological Concerns Log above.

[Observations, or "No concerns noted."]

---

## Report Verification (RV-3)

> **Completed after all scripts are re-executed.** Cross-references specific claims, statistics, and figures from the original Report against the reproduced outputs.

### Quantitative Claims

| # | Report Claim | Report Location | Original Value | Reproduced Value | Match? | Notes |
|---|-------------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | [Specific stat or finding cited in Report] | [Section, paragraph] | [value] | [value from re-run] | [Yes/No/Approx] | [If no: magnitude and likely cause] |

### Figure Verification

| # | Finding | Report Section | Supported by Reproduced Data? | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---------|---------------|-------------------------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | [Finding statement] | [Section] | [Yes / Partially / No] | [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] | [explanation] |

### Report Verification Summary

**Claims verified:** [N] of [N]
**Claims matching:** [N] ([X]%)
**Figures reproduced:** [N] of [N]
**Findings supported:** [N] of [N]

[Brief narrative: Are the Report's conclusions substantiated by the reproduction? Any caveats?]

## Reproduction Environment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **DAAF Version** | [git commit hash] |
| **Session Model ID** | [Model driving the orchestrator/main session at reproduction start — record the runtime value, e.g., claude-opus-4-8[1m]] |
| **Subagent Model Tiers** | [Distinct specialist model IDs by tier used during reproduction (re-execution, debugging, verification) — from agent frontmatter defaults plus any per-dispatch overrides. Record resolved IDs where known, or the tier alias + session date otherwise — e.g., "opus tier: claude-opus-4-8[1m]; sonnet tier: claude-sonnet-4-5". Record BOTH session and subagent models of the reproduction run; the original run's models are separately captured from its Report's AI Disclosure.] |
| **Reproduction Date** | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| **Original Analysis Date** | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| **Python Version** | [e.g., 3.12] |
| **Key Packages** | [polars version, plotnine version, etc.] |

### Environment Compatibility Assessment

> **Populated during RV-1** by comparing the reproduction environment against the original analysis environment. The original environment is reconstructed from the Dockerfile at the original DAAF version (identified via the Report's AI Disclosure commit hash or version citation) by fetching it from the public DAAF repository.

**Original DAAF Version:** [commit hash from Report's AI Disclosure, e.g., `abc1234`]
**Original DAAF Release:** [semver if identifiable, e.g., `v2.1.0`, or `—` if not mapped to a release]
**Current DAAF Version:** [current commit hash]
**Current DAAF Release:** [current semver if identifiable]
**Original Dockerfile Source:** [URL used to fetch, e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf/{hash}/Dockerfile`, or `unavailable — see notes`]

**Overall Compatibility:** [COMPATIBLE / MINOR DIFFERENCES / SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES / UNKNOWN]

| Package | Original Version | Current Version | Status | Risk |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|------|
| [package_name] | [version] | [version] | [MATCH/PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR/ADDED/REMOVED] | [—/description] |

**Status Definitions:**
- **MATCH**: Identical version — no risk
- **PATCH**: Patch version differs (x.y.Z) — minimal risk, bug fixes only
- **MINOR**: Minor version differs (x.Y.z) — low-moderate risk, new features may change defaults
- **MAJOR**: Major version differs (X.y.z) — high risk, breaking changes likely
- **ADDED**: Package present in current environment but absent in original — no direct risk unless it shadows behavior
- **REMOVED**: Package present in original environment but absent in current — high risk, scripts may fail

**Compatibility Summary:**
- Packages compared: [N]
- MATCH: [N] | PATCH: [N] | MINOR: [N] | MAJOR: [N] | ADDED: [N] | REMOVED: [N]

**User Decision:** [Proceed with current environment / Rebuilt to match original / N/A — environments compatible]

**Impact on Reproduction Assessment:**
[Statement about how environment differences should be factored into interpretation of deviations. E.g., "Environment differences are minimal and unlikely to cause deviations" or "Significant version differences in polars and statsmodels may explain observed deviations in transform and analysis scripts — deviations in scripts using these packages should be interpreted with this context."]

---

## Deviation Log

> **Running log of ALL deviations**, consolidated from per-script sections for easy scanning. Each row is added as deviations are discovered during RV-2.

| # | Script | Deviation Type | Description | Substantive? | Likely Cause |
|---|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1 | [name] | [Output difference / Runtime error / Required modification / Data change] | [brief] | [Yes/No] | [cause] |

**Deviation Type Definitions:**
- **Output difference** — Script ran but produced different numerical results
- **Runtime error** — Script failed to execute (dependency, path, API change, etc.)
- **Required modification** — Script needed code changes to run at all
- **Data change** — Upstream data source returned different data than original fetch

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create

Create `Reproduction_Report.md` during **RV-1 (Intake & Setup)** after copying original artifacts and running the decompiler.

### Update Cadence

This report must be updated **after every single script re-execution** during RV-2. Do not batch updates. The report is both a live progress tracker and a final deliverable — it must be current at all times.

**After each script re-execution:**
1. Update the Script Inventory table (Repro Status column)
2. Fill in the Per-Script Reproduction Results section for that script
3. Add any deviations to the Deviation Log
4. Add any methodological concerns to the Concerns Log

**After RV-3 (Report Verification):**
5. Fill in all Report Verification tables

**During RV-4 (Synthesis):**
6. Write the Executive Summary
7. Write the Methodological Concerns Synthesis
8. Write the Report Verification Summary narrative

### Comparison Tolerances

When comparing original vs. reproduced outputs, apply these tolerances:

| Metric | Exact Match Required? | Tolerance |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| Row count | Yes | 0 (must match exactly) |
| Column count | Yes | 0 |
| Column names | Yes | 0 |
| Column dtypes | Yes | 0 |
| Integer values | Yes | 0 |
| Float values | No | 1e-6 relative tolerance |
| String values | Yes | 0 |
| Null counts | Yes | 0 |
| Row ordering | No | Order-independent comparison acceptable |
| Timestamps in logs | No | Expected to differ |
| File paths in logs | No | Expected to differ if project moved |
| Figure pixel comparison | No | Visual inspection via read tool |

### Substantive vs. Cosmetic Deviations

- **Cosmetic:** Timestamps, file paths, floating-point display rounding, row ordering. These are expected and do not affect reproducibility assessment.
- **Substantive:** Different row counts, different column values, missing data, changed statistical results, different figures. These indicate genuine reproducibility issues.

Only substantive deviations affect the overall reproducibility assessment.

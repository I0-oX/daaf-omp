## Iteration Limits Summary

**Standardized limits for all error types:**

| Error Type | Max Attempts | After Max Attempts | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Data unavailable | 0 | Escalate immediately | User must decide path forward |
| Access/network error | 3 | Stop, report to user | Exponential backoff between attempts |
| Code execution error | 2 | Stop, escalate to user | Try alternative approach on 2nd attempt |
| Validation failure (STOP condition) | 0 | Escalate immediately | Never retry STOP conditions |
| Validation failure (warning) | N/A | Document and proceed | Warnings don't consume retries |
| **QA BLOCKER (non-methodology)** | 2 | Stop, escalate to user | Apply Rule 5 fixes via revision (2 revision scripts: _a.py, _b.py after original fails) |
| **QA BLOCKER (methodology)** | 0 | Escalate immediately | Becomes Rule 4 escalation |
| **QA WARNING** | N/A | Document, flag for Stage 10 | Warnings don't block progress |
| Plan check failure | 2 revisions | Return to planning | Original check + max 2 revision cycles |
| Verification gap | 3 | Stop, report to user | Gap may indicate fundamental issue |
| Subagent re-invocation | 3 | Stop, fundamental issue | May need task redesign |

## Error Classification

| Category | Examples | Typical Resolution | Per-Incident Limit |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Data Availability** | No data exists, mirror file not found | Escalate immediately | 0 retries |
| **Access/Network** | Timeout, 404 (mirror file not found), network errors | Retry with backoff | 3 retries |
| **Data Quality** | High suppression, unexpected nulls | Adjust approach or escalate | Varies |
| **Code Execution** | Syntax errors, runtime errors | Fix and retry | 2 attempts |
| **Validation Failure** | Checkpoint failed | Investigate and fix or escalate | Varies by severity |
| **QA BLOCKER** | Code-reviewer finds correctness issue | Revision via Rule 5 | 2 revisions |
| **QA Methodology Issue** | Code contradicts Plan | Escalate immediately | 0 revisions |
| **Resource** | Memory, timeout | Optimize or escalate | 1 attempt |

## Error Recovery Routing

When errors occur during pipeline execution, this routing determines which agent handles recovery:

```
ERROR DETECTED
      |
      +- Data issue (empty, wrong shape)?
      |       +-> research-executor retry (max 2)
      |               +-> debugger (if still failing)
      |
      +- QA BLOCKER found (code-reviewer)?
      |       +-> Is it a methodology issue?
      |               +-> YES -> ESCALATE to user immediately
      |               +-> NO -> research-executor revision
      |                       +-> code-reviewer re-reviews
      |                               +-> Resolved -> Proceed
      |                               +-> Still BLOCKER after 2 attempts -> ESCALATE
      |
      +- Transformation issue (unexpected row loss)?
      |       +-> debugger
      |               +-> Fix identified -> research-executor applies fix
      |               +-> Root cause unclear -> ESCALATE to user
      |
      +- Plan issue (missing section, ambiguous task)?
      |       +-> data-planner (revision)
      |               +-> plan-checker validates
      |
      +- Integration issue (broken references)?
      |       +-> integration-checker diagnoses
      |               +-> Orchestrator coordinates fix
      |
      +- Verification failure (stub detected, missing artifact)?
              +-> data-verifier documents
                      +-> Orchestrator coordinates completion
```

**Agent-Specific Error Budgets:**

| Agent | Max Attempts | Then |
|-------|-------------|------|
| research-executor | 2 retries per task | Invoke debugger |
| code-reviewer | 2 revision cycles per script | Escalate to user |
| debugger | 5 hypothesis cycles | Escalate to user |
| data-planner | 2 revision cycles | Escalate to user |
| Any agent | Context degradation detected | Compress and continue or restart |

---

## Debugger Invocation Template

The debugger agent is invoked during error recovery, not at a fixed pipeline stage. It is the only agent invoked on-demand rather than at a predetermined stage.

```python
task({
    description: "Debug: [Brief Error Description]",
    prompt: """You are a Debugger. Read and follow the protocol in
    `{BASE_DIR}/.omp/agents/debugger.md`.

    **BASE_DIR:** {BASE_DIR}
    All relative paths in referenced files resolve from BASE_DIR.

    [If data transformation issue: Call the skill tool with name 'polars'.]

    **CONTEXT:**
    Research Question: [verbatim]
    Plan Path: {BASE_DIR}/research/[project]/[Plan filename]
    Plan Tasks Path: {BASE_DIR}/research/[project]/[Plan_Tasks filename]

    **ERROR DETAILS:**
    - Error message: [verbatim error or symptom]
    - Stage and step: [Stage N, Step M]
    - Failed script: {BASE_DIR}/research/[project]/scripts/[path]
    - Last successful operation: [description + output]
    [If QA-triggered:]
    - QA report: {BASE_DIR}/research/[project]/scripts/cr/[cr script path]
    - Specific BLOCKER check: [which check failed]

    Diagnose the root cause using scientific hypothesis-testing.
    Return findings using the Debugger Output Format.""",
    subagent_type: "debugger"
})
```

## Session Error Budget

To prevent infinite retry loops and excessive resource consumption, track cumulative errors across the entire analysis session.

### Budget Limits

| Error Type | Per-Stage Limit | Session Limit | Action When Exceeded |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Data access retries | 3 | 9 | STOP with comprehensive error report |
| Code fix attempts | 2 | 6 | STOP, escalate to user |
| **QA BLOCKER revisions** | 2 per script | 8 per session | STOP, escalate to user |
| **QA methodology issues** | 0 | 2 | STOP, fundamental methodology question |
| Subagent re-invocations | 3 | 9 | STOP, fundamental issue present |
| Validation failures (STOP conditions) | 0 | 3 | STOP, analysis may not be feasible |

### Data Onboarding Error Budgets

| Resource | Per-Part Limit | Session Limit | Notes |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Code fix attempts | 2 | 6 | Per profiling part (A/B/C/D) |
| Subagent re-invocations | 3 | 9 | Per profiling part |
| QA BLOCKER revisions | 2 | 8 | Per script within phase; 2 max before escalation |
| STOP conditions | — | 3 | Session-wide |
| QA escalations | — | 3 | Incremented when QA BLOCKER remains unresolved after max revision attempts and must be escalated to user |

> **Budget asymmetry note:** Session limits are deliberately lower than the sum of per-part limits (e.g., Code fix: 2/part × 4 = 8, but session limit is 6). This prevents error concentration — a session that consumes its full per-part budget in every part indicates systemic issues that warrant user intervention rather than continued automated recovery.

**Budget read-gating:** The Per-Part Execution Cycle's Step 0 (in `.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/references/data-onboarding-mode.md`) performs budget read-gating before each profiling part. If remaining budget is 0 for any category, the orchestrator must escalate to the user before proceeding.

### Budget Tracking

The orchestrator MUST track cumulative errors in STATE.md's `## Error Budget Consumed` section:

```markdown
### Error Budget Status

| Error Type | Used | Remaining | Status |
|------------|------|-----------|--------|
| Data access retries | 4 | 5/9 | ⚠️ Elevated |
| Code attempts | 2 | 4/6 | ✅ Normal |
| Subagent re-invocations | 1 | 8/9 | ✅ Normal |
| STOP conditions hit | 1 | 2/3 | ⚠️ Warning |
```

### Budget Read-Gating

The orchestrator reads the Error Budget Consumed section from STATE.md at Step 0 of each Composite Execution Pattern cycle (see `full-pipeline-mode.md`). If any category has remaining budget ≤ 0, the orchestrator MUST STOP and follow the Budget Exhaustion Protocol below rather than dispatching the next task. This ensures budget enforcement is data-driven (read from STATE.md) rather than memory-dependent.

**Data Onboarding mode:** The Per-Part Execution Cycle's Step 0 (in `data-onboarding-mode.md`) performs budget read-gating before each profiling part. The orchestrator reads STATE.md's Error Budget Consumed section and confirms remaining budget > 0 before dispatching the next part's subagent.

### Budget Exhaustion Protocol

When any session limit is exceeded:

1. **STOP all execution immediately**
2. **Generate comprehensive error report:**
   ```markdown
   **STOP: Session Error Budget Exhausted**
   
   **Budget Type:** [Data access retries | Code attempts | Subagent invocations | STOP conditions]
   **Limit:** [N]
   **Consumed:** [N+]
   
   **Error History:**
   | Stage | Error | Attempts | Resolution |
   |-------|-------|----------|------------|
   | Stage 5 | Data access timeout | 3 | Eventual success |
   | Stage 7 | Join error | 2 | Fixed |
   | Stage 7 | Transform error | 2 | Fixed |
   | Stage 7 | Filter error | 2 | Failed (budget exhausted) |
   
   **Analysis:**
   The high error rate suggests [fundamental data issue | Data access instability | methodology mismatch | complexity too high].
   
   **Recommendation:**
   [Simplify scope | Wait and retry later | Alternative data source | Escalate for manual intervention]
   
   Awaiting your guidance.
   ```
3. **Update Plan with budget exhaustion in Issues section**
4. **Await user guidance before any further attempts**

### Preventive Measures

To stay within budget:
- **Be precise in subagent prompts** to avoid re-invocations
- **Verify query parameters before execution** to avoid data access failures
- **Review code before execution** when delegating complex transformations
- **Escalate proactively** when patterns suggest fundamental issues

## Category-Specific Recovery

### Data Availability Errors

**Definition:** The requested data does not exist in the data access mirrors.

**Examples:**
- Endpoint returns 404
- Variable not found
- Years not available
- No data for specified filters

**Recovery:** ESCALATE IMMEDIATELY

```markdown
**STOP: Data Unavailable**

**What I Searched:**
- Endpoint: [endpoint]
- Filters: [filters]
- Years: [years]

**What I Found:**
[Description of what was or wasn't available]

**Impact:**
[How this affects the research question]

**Options:**
1. **Alternative data source:** [if available]
2. **Modify research question:** [suggested modification]
3. **Use proxy variable:** [if applicable]
4. **Acknowledge limitation:** Proceed without this data, document limitation

**Recommendation:**
[Your suggested path]

Awaiting your guidance before proceeding.
```

---

### Data Access/Network Errors

**Definition:** Transient errors from data access mirror communication.

**Examples:**
- Connection timeout
- 429 Too Many Requests
- 500/502/503 Server errors
- Network unreachable

**Recovery:** Retry with exponential backoff

```python
import polars as pl

def fetch_from_mirrors(mirrors: list[dict], dataset_path: str) -> pl.DataFrame:
    """Download data from configured mirrors with fallback."""
    errors = []

    for mirror in mirrors:
        url = mirror["url_template"].format(path=dataset_path)
        try:
            if mirror.get("read_strategy") == "eager_parquet":
                df = pl.read_parquet(url)
            else:
                df = pl.read_csv(url)
            print(f"Mirror: {mirror['name']} — {df.shape[0]:,} rows fetched")
            return df

        except Exception as e:
            errors.append(f"{mirror['name']}: {e}")
            print(f"Mirror {mirror['name']} failed: {e}")
            continue

    # All mirrors failed
    error_report = "\n".join(errors)
    raise RuntimeError(
        f"All mirrors failed for {dataset_path}:\n{error_report}\n"
        "STOP: Escalate to user — check mirrors.yaml configuration"
    )
```

**If retry fails:** ESCALATE

```markdown
**STOP: Data Access Error After Retries**

**Endpoint:** [URL]
**Error:** [error message]
**Attempts:** 3

**Possible Causes:**
- Data access mirror service disruption
- Rate limiting exceeded
- Invalid mirror file path

**Recommendation:**
Wait and retry later, or verify endpoint is correct.

Awaiting guidance.
```

---

### Data Quality Errors

**Definition:** Data retrieved but quality issues prevent analysis.

**Examples:**
- Suppression rate >50%
- Unexpected missingness patterns
- Data type mismatches
- Impossible values

**Recovery Decision Tree:**

```
Data Quality Issue
    │
    ├─ Is suppression rate >50%?
    │   └─ YES → STOP, propose alternatives:
    │            - Aggregate to higher level (state instead of district)
    │            - Use different variable
    │            - Document limitation and proceed if acceptable
    │
    ├─ Are there unexpected nulls?
    │   └─ YES → Investigate source
    │            ├─ From data access source (expected) → Document
    │            ├─ From transformation (bug) → Fix code
    │            └─ Unknown → STOP, investigate
    │
    ├─ Are there impossible values?
    │   └─ YES → Investigate
    │            ├─ Coded value not filtered → Fix filter
    │            ├─ Data entry error → Document, filter
    │            └─ Unknown → STOP, investigate
    │
    └─ Other quality issue → Document and assess impact
```

**Escalation format:**

```markdown
**STOP: Data Quality Issue**

**Issue:** [description]
**Variable(s):** [affected variables]
**Severity:** [rate/extent]

**Investigation:**
[What you found when investigating]

**Impact:**
[How this affects the analysis]

**Options:**
1. [Option with tradeoffs]
2. [Option with tradeoffs]
3. [Option with tradeoffs]

**Recommendation:** [your suggestion]

Awaiting guidance.
```

---

### Code Execution Errors

**Definition:** Python code fails to execute.

**Examples:**
- SyntaxError
- TypeError
- KeyError
- MemoryError

**Recovery:** Fix and retry (max 2 attempts) using **script versioning**

**CRITICAL: File-First Script Versioning**

Closely read `agent_reference/SCRIPT_EXECUTION_REFERENCE.md` for the mandatory file-first execution protocol covering complete code file writing, output capture, and file versioning rules.

When a script fails, DO NOT modify the original. Instead:
1. Original script (`01_task.py`) keeps its failed output appended (audit trail)
2. Create versioned copy (`01_task_a.py`) with fixes
3. Execute with automatic output capture wrapper to the new version
4. If still failing, create `01_task_b.py`, etc.
5. Marimo notebook uses only the final successful version

**Attempt 1: Create versioned fix**
```
1. Read the full error traceback in the script's appended output
2. Identify the root cause
3. Create new versioned copy (e.g., 01_task_a.py)
4. Apply fix in the new copy
5. Execute (single Bash call): `bash {BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh {PROJECT_DIR}/scripts/.../01_task_a.py`
```

**Attempt 2: Alternative approach in new version**
```
1. If same error, create another version (e.g., 01_task_b.py)
2. Try different approach in this copy
3. Execute and capture output
```

**If still failing after 2 attempts:** ESCALATE

```markdown
**STOP: Code Execution Error**

**Error:** [error type and message]

**Code:**
```python
[relevant code snippet]
```

**Attempts:**
1. [What was tried and result]
2. [What was tried and result]

**Analysis:**
[Your understanding of the issue]

**Recommendation:**
[Suggested resolution or alternative approach]

Awaiting guidance.
```

### QA BLOCKER Recovery (NEW)

**Definition:** code-reviewer returns BLOCKER severity after script review.

**Types of QA BLOCKERs:**

| Type | Examples | Recovery |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Wrong join type, incorrect filter, type mismatch | Fix via revision (Rule 5) |
| **Validation Gap** | Missing checkpoint, inadequate invariants | Add validation via revision |
| **Stub/Placeholder** | TODO, FIXME, pass, NotImplementedError | Complete implementation |
| **Data Corruption** | Unexpected nulls, wrong row count | Fix transformation |
| **Methodology** | Code contradicts Plan specification | ESCALATE immediately (Rule 4) |

**Additional BLOCKER types for Data Onboarding profiling QA (QAP1-QAP4):**

| Type | Example | Remediation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Profiling Accuracy | Distribution claim unsupported by data; uniqueness count incorrect | Re-run profiling script with corrected logic |
| Interpretation Discipline | Semantic interpretation missing [PRELIMINARY] marker | Re-run interpretation script with markers enforced |
| Coded Value Omission | Standard sentinels (-1, -9, -99, -999) present but not catalogued | Re-run quality-anomaly script with expanded scan |

**Recovery Flow:**

```
code-reviewer returns BLOCKER
    │
    ├─ Is it a methodology issue?
    │   ├─ YES → STOP, escalate to user (Rule 4)
    │   └─ NO → Continue to revision
    │
    ├─ Revision Attempt 1
    │   ├─ Create new versioned script (_a.py or next suffix)
    │   ├─ Apply fix suggested by code-reviewer
    │   ├─ Execute with full validation
    │   └─ Return for re-QA
    │
    ├─ Re-QA results
    │   ├─ PASSED/WARNING → Proceed
    │   └─ Still BLOCKER → Revision Attempt 2
    │
    ├─ Revision Attempt 2
    │   ├─ Create next versioned script (_b.py)
    │   ├─ Try different approach
    │   ├─ Execute with full validation
    │   └─ Return for re-QA
    │
    └─ After 2 attempts, still BLOCKER → ESCALATE
```

**Revision Request Format:**

```markdown
**REVISION REQUEST: [Task Name]**

**Original Script:** scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step}_{name}.py
**Current Version:** scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step}_{name}_{suffix}.py

**QA BLOCKER Issue:**
- **Type:** [Correctness | Validation Gap | Stub | Data Corruption]
- **Description:** [What's wrong]
- **Location:** [Where in code]
- **Suggested Fix:** [From code-reviewer]

**Instructions:**
1. Create new versioned script: {step}_{name}_{next_suffix}.py
2. Apply fix for the BLOCKER issue
3. Execute with full validation
4. Append execution log
5. Return execution report

**Do NOT modify prior script versions** — they serve as audit trail.
```

**Escalation after 2 failed revisions:**

```markdown
**STOP: QA BLOCKER Unresolved**

**Script:** scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step}_{name}.py
**Issue:** [QA BLOCKER description]

**Revision Attempts:**
1. **{script}_a.py:** [What was tried and result]
2. **{script}_b.py:** [What was tried and result]

**Analysis:**
[Why the issue persists despite two fix attempts]

**Options:**
1. [Option with implications]
2. [Option with implications]
3. [Option with implications]

**Recommendation:**
[Your suggested path forward]

Awaiting guidance.
```

### Validation Failures

**Definition:** A checkpoint (CP1-CP4) fails.

**STOP Conditions (require escalation):**
- CP1: Empty data, missing critical columns
- CP2: >50% suppression, >90% data loss
- CP3: >90% row loss after transformation
- CP4: Missing critical requirements

**Warning Conditions (document and proceed):**
- High but acceptable missingness
- Unexpected but manageable row count changes
- Non-critical columns with issues

**Recovery:**

```
Validation Failure
    │
    ├─ Is it a STOP condition?
    │   └─ YES → ESCALATE immediately
    │
    ├─ Is it fixable?
    │   ├─ YES → Fix and re-validate
    │   └─ NO → Document and proceed (if warning-level)
    │
    └─ Document in Plan regardless of severity
```

---

## Recovery from Different Stages (Data Onboarding)

Data Onboarding uses a different error recovery pattern than the Full Pipeline. The Per-Part Execution Cycle in `data-onboarding-mode.md` defines the atomic unit of work, and STATE.md (the sole persistent document) tracks all progress.

### Stage-Specific Recovery

| Stage | Common Errors | Recovery Action |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| DI-0 (API Acquisition) | API auth failure (401/403), rate limit (429), empty response, unreachable docs, pagination error | Verify API key env var is set and valid; retry with backoff (max 3); adjust query params if empty response; fall back to user description if docs unreachable; reduce page size if pagination fails |
| DI-1 (Intake) | File not found, file empty, missing inputs | Re-collect inputs from user; verify file path and accessibility |
| DI-2 (Project Setup) | Folder creation fails | Create folder manually; verify `{BASE_DIR}/scripts/run_with_capture.sh` is accessible |
| DI-3 (Part A) | Encoding errors, format detection failure, CPP1 fails | Check file format; try alternative encoding; re-invoke data-ingest subagent |
| DI-4 (Part B) | Distribution analysis errors, temporal column misidentified | Review Part A conditional decisions; re-invoke with corrected decisions |
| DI-5 (Part C) | Key detection failure, no candidate keys found | Expand composite key search; consult user about grain of data |
| DI-6 (Part D) | Interpretation ambiguity, documentation contradicts data | Flag uncertainties as [PRELIMINARY] with LOW confidence; proceed to PSU-DI2 for user review |
| DI-7 (Skill Authoring) | Template compliance failure (CPP-SKILL) | Revise skill draft (max 2 attempts); escalate if still non-compliant |
| DI-8 (Review & Delivery) | User rejects skill | Collect feedback; return to DI-7 with revision instructions |

### Data Onboarding STOP Conditions

| Condition | Triggered By | Recovery Path |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| API authentication fails | data-ingest agent (DI-0) or Gate GDI-0 | User verifies API key env var name and value; re-generate key if expired |
| API returns empty dataset | data-ingest agent (DI-0) or Gate GDI-0 | User verifies endpoint URL and query parameters; check if filters are too restrictive |
| API rate limited | data-ingest agent (DI-0) | Retry with exponential backoff; reduce request scope; wait and retry |
| File cannot be loaded | data-ingest agent (Part A) | User provides corrected file or format info |
| File is empty | data-ingest agent (Part A) | User provides correct file |
| >50% documented columns missing | data-ingest agent (Part D) or Gate GDI-6 | Verify correct file version; user confirms column mapping |
| File >1GB without sampling guidance | data-ingest agent or Gate GDI-3 | User approves sampling strategy |
| Critical columns entirely null | data-ingest agent | User verifies data extraction was complete |
| >50% of columns entirely null | Gate GDI-4 | User verifies file is not truncated or corrupted |
| No candidate keys identifiable | Gate GDI-5 | User provides domain knowledge about data grain |
| Template compliance fails after 2 revisions | Gate GDI-7 | Escalate to user; manual skill editing may be needed |

### Revision Request Format (Data Onboarding)

When re-invoking the data-ingest subagent to fix a BLOCKER:

```
**REVISION REQUEST**
Part: {A/B/C/D}
Failing script: {script_path}
BLOCKER: {description from code-reviewer}
QA script: {qa_script_path}

Fix the identified issue in a new script version ({script_name}_a.py).
The original script with its execution log is an immutable audit artifact — do not modify it.
```

### Revision and Extension Mode Error Recovery

Revision and Extension mode re-executes pipeline stages using Full Pipeline's error recovery patterns. The standard QA BLOCKER revision flow (max 2 attempts, then escalate) applies to all re-executed scripts.

**Revision-specific considerations:**

| Error | Source | Recovery |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Prior version data files missing/corrupted | Re-execution depends on prior Stage 5-6 outputs | Re-run from earliest affected stage rather than just the revision's re-entry point |
| Revision scope grows beyond classification | Mid-execution discovery | STOP, present to user, re-classify or escalate to Full Pipeline |
| STATE.md from prior version is incomplete | Missing execution context | Reconstruct from filesystem (script execution logs, git history) before planning revision |

For QA BLOCKER revision requests during re-execution, use the standard Revision Request format from the Full Pipeline section above.

### Reproducibility Verification Mode Error Recovery

RV mode has a lightweight error recovery pattern. The per-script atomic cycle handles most failures inline — the code-reviewer creates versioned modifications (`_repro_a.py`, `_repro_b.py`) when scripts fail.

| Stage | Common Errors | Recovery Action |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| RV-1 (Intake) | Notebook not found, decompiler fails, Report missing | Verify paths; check notebook is valid marimo format; re-run decompiler with verbose output |
| RV-2 (Re-execution) | Script fails to execute, execution log not stripped properly | Create `_repro_a.py` with minimal fixes; verify `# EXECUTION LOG` marker removed; dispatch debugger if modification also fails (max 3 debugger dispatches per session) |
| RV-2 (Re-execution) | Data re-fetch returns different data | Log as Data change deviation; if schema differs, STOP and present to user (escalation trigger) |
| RV-3 (Verification) | Claim cannot be traced to any script | Document as unverifiable; note in Report Verification |
| RV-4 (Synthesis) | Reproduction Report incomplete | Return to orchestrator; orchestrator fills gaps before re-dispatching |

**RV-Specific Error Budget:**

| Error Type | Per-Script Limit | Session Limit | After Max |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Script modification versions | 2 (`_repro_a.py`, `_repro_b.py`) | — | Mark FAILED, continue to next script |
| Debugger dispatches | 1 per script | 3 per session | Mark FAILED, continue |
| Data source schema change | — | — | STOP, present to user immediately |

**Key difference from Full Pipeline:** RV mode does NOT stop on individual script failures. The goal is a complete reproduction picture — failed scripts are documented and the process continues to the next script.

### Framework Development Mode Error Recovery

Framework Development errors are typically file-level issues (template compliance failures, integration checklist gaps, cross-reference breaks). Recovery is straightforward:

| Error Type | Recovery |
|------------|----------|
| Template compliance failure | Re-read the canonical template, identify missing sections, create revised artifact |
| Integration checklist gap | Re-read FRAMEWORK_INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md, identify and complete missing items |
| Cross-file inconsistency | Grep for the component name across all framework files, fix discrepancies |
| Name collision | Choose a different name; update all already-written references |

**STOP Conditions:** If the error involves safety-critical files (AGENTS.md, config.yml, extensions), escalate to the user immediately.

## Re-run Procedures

### When to Re-run a Stage

| Situation | Stage(s) to Re-run | Mode |
|-----------|-------------------|------|
| Wrong endpoints identified | 2 | Refresh |
| Missing data source | 2, 3 | Additive |
| Caveats misunderstood | 3 | Refresh (affected source) |
| Query returned wrong data | 5 | Refresh |
| Transformation logic wrong | 7 | Refresh |
| Visualization incorrect | 8 | Refresh |

### Re-run Modes

**Refresh Mode:**
- Replace prior stage output entirely
- Use when fundamental assumptions were wrong
- Requires updating Plan document

**Additive Mode:**
- Supplement prior output with new findings
- Use when scope expanded or new elements added
- Add to existing Plan sections

### Re-run Invocation

```python
task({
    description: "Stage [N] Re-run: [Name]",
    prompt: """Previous execution encountered issues.

**ISSUE:** [what went wrong]
**MODE:** [REFRESH | ADDITIVE]

**CORRECTIVE CONTEXT:**
[What to do differently]

[If ADDITIVE: Prior findings to preserve: ...]

Re-execute the stage with this correction.

[Original stage specification]""",
    subagent_type: "[agent-name]"
})
```

## Error Logging

All errors should be logged in the Plan document:

```markdown
## Error Log

| Timestamp | Stage | Error | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|-------|------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Stage N | [Brief description] | [How resolved or escalated] |
```

---

## Session-Level Recovery

Session transcript archiving is handled automatically by two hooks that work as a pair:

- **`archive-session.sh`** (fires on `session_shutdown`): Archives the complete JSONL transcript and a human-readable Markdown rendering to `.omp/logs/sessions/`, including all subagent transcripts discovered from OMP's raw file hierarchy.
- **`recover-session-logs.sh`** (fires on `session_start`): Runs a background scan for raw transcripts that were never archived — typically from sessions that crashed, were killed, or lost network connectivity before `session_shutdown` fired. For each orphaned transcript found, it pipes a synthesized payload to `archive-session.sh`, reusing all existing archiving logic. Recovered archives are timestamped using the last entry in the original transcript (not the recovery runtime), so they sort chronologically by when the session actually ran.

**No manual intervention is required.** Orphaned transcripts are recovered automatically on the next session start. The idempotency guard in `archive-session.sh` (file-size comparison keyed on session ID) prevents duplicate archives and ensures that if a still-running session was prematurely archived by recovery, the complete version from `session_shutdown` replaces the partial one.

# STATE.md Template (Data Onboarding Mode)

This template defines the session state file for Data Onboarding Mode. It is a lightweight adaptation of the Full Pipeline STATE template, tailored for profiling workflows.

---

## Template

Copy this template to `STATE.md` in the project folder when starting a Data Onboarding Mode session.

```markdown
# Session State: [Source Name] Data Onboarding

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Session Count:** [N]

## Current Position

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project** | [Full title, e.g., "County Presidential Election Returns Onboarding"] |
| **Current Phase** | [DI-0/DI-1/DI-2/DI-3]: [Phase Name] |
| **Current Stage** | [DI-0 through DI-8]: [Stage Name] |
| **Status** | [In Progress / Blocked / Complete] |

## Session Metadata

> Captured at project setup for AI use disclosure (see `agent_reference/AI_DISCLOSURE_REFERENCE.md`). The orchestrator populates these fields when creating STATE.md.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **DAAF Version** | [Short git commit hash — from `git rev-parse --short HEAD` at project setup] |
| **Session Model ID** | [Model identifier driving the orchestrator/main session at session start — record the runtime value, not this example (e.g., "claude-opus-4-8[1m]")] |
| **Subagent Model Tiers** | [Distinct specialist model IDs by tier, from agent frontmatter defaults (`model: opus` / `model: sonnet`) plus any per-dispatch overrides the orchestrator applied. Record resolved IDs where known, or the tier alias + session date otherwise — e.g., "opus tier: claude-opus-4-8[1m]; sonnet tier: claude-sonnet-4-5". See `.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/SKILL.md` > "Model Selection for Subagent Dispatch" and AI_DISCLOSURE_REFERENCE.md > Multi-Model Sessions.] |
| **Session Date(s)** | [Date(s) of profiling sessions — e.g., "2026-03-23"] |
| **Session Transcript(s)** | `logs/` — collected at project completion via `collect_session_logs.sh` |

- **PASSED** — Part QA review passed (no issues)
- **WARNING** — Non-blocking issues logged
- **REVISED** — BLOCKER resolved via script revision

**Note:** QA is part-level, not per-script. The QA Script Path column is populated only for the first script in each part (the QA review covers all scripts in that part together).

**Multi-file expansion (HIERARCHICAL only):** For HIERARCHICAL file structures, expand the table with per-file rows using the suffix convention. For example, with 2 files (schools + districts):
- Row `01a` for `01a_load-and-format.py` (schools), row `01b` for `01b_load-and-format.py` (districts)
- Similarly for scripts 02, 03, 04, 07, 09, 10

## Profiling Preliminary Notes

> Orchestrator writes lossless agent findings to disk as preliminary notes files
> immediately upon receiving each profiling agent's return. These files persist the
> full agent output (zero compression) and are referenced by subsequent profiling
> parts and the DI-7 skill authoring agent for full-fidelity access to prior
> findings. Gate conditions prevent the next part from proceeding until the
> current part's notes file exists on disk.

| Part | Agent | File Path | Status |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| A | data-ingest | `output/preliminary_notes/{date}_partA_structural-discovery.md` | [PENDING/WRITTEN] |
| B | data-ingest | `output/preliminary_notes/{date}_partB_statistical-deep-dive.md` | [PENDING/WRITTEN] |
| C | data-ingest | `output/preliminary_notes/{date}_partC_relational-analysis.md` | [PENDING/WRITTEN] |
| D | data-ingest | `output/preliminary_notes/{date}_partD_interpretation-reconciliation.md` | [PENDING/WRITTEN] |

**Status Values:**
- **PENDING** — Agent not yet dispatched or return not yet persisted
- **WRITTEN** — File exists on disk with full lossless agent return

**Note:** All four rows must show WRITTEN before DI-7 skill authoring can proceed.
- Script `07b` appears once (cross-file, not per-file)
- Conditional scripts (05, 06, 08) appear per-file only if applicable to that specific file
- Script 11 appears once (cross-file documentation reconciliation)

---

## Interpretation Tracking

*Tracks preliminary interpretations from Part D and user decisions at PSU-DI2.*

| Column/Feature | Preliminary Interpretation | User Decision | Final Interpretation | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| [column name] | [PRELIMINARY: interpretation from script 10] | [CONFIRMED/REJECTED/MODIFIED] | [final interpretation or "—" if rejected] | [user feedback] |
| [pattern/anomaly] | [PRELIMINARY: interpretation from script 10] | [CONFIRMED/REJECTED/MODIFIED] | [final interpretation] | [user feedback] |

**Populated:** Part D (script 10 output) → PSU-DI2 (user review) → Stage DI-7 (skill authoring uses Final Interpretation column)

---

## Documentation Reconciliation Summary

*Populated during Part D (script 11) if documentation was provided.*

| # | Discrepancy | Severity | Documented Claim | Observed Reality | Resolution |
|---|-------------|----------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | [description] | [BLOCKER/WARNING/INFO] | [what docs say] | [what data shows] | [how handled in skill] |

**Documentation Status:** [Not provided / Reconciliation complete / Reconciliation pending]

## Key Decisions Made

> All runtime decisions made during the onboarding session are recorded here.

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Stage |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| [Topic] | [What was decided] | [Why] | [DI-N] |

---

## Blockers

### Execution Blockers
| Blocker | Stage | Impact | Resolution |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|
| [None or description] | [DI-N] | [effect] | [what's needed] |

### QA Blockers (Pending Resolution)
| Script | Part | Issue | Revision Attempts | Status |

## Error Budget Consumed

### Per-Part (Current Part)
| Resource | Used | Limit | Remaining |
|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Code Attempts | [X] | 2 | [Y] |
| Subagent Re-invocations | [X] | 3 | [Y] |
| **QA BLOCKER Revisions** | [X] | 2 | [Y] |

### QA Budget (Parts A-D)
| Part | Scripts | BLOCKERs Resolved | WARNINGs Logged | Escalations |
|------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| A (Structural) | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] |
| B (Statistical) | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] |
| C (Relational) | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] |
| D (Interpretation) | [N] | [N] | [N] | [N] |

### Session Total
| Resource | Used | Limit | Remaining |
|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| Code Attempts | [X] | 6 | [Y] |
| Subagent Re-invocations | [X] | 9 | [Y] |
| **QA BLOCKER Revisions** | [X] | 8 | [Y] |
| STOP Conditions | [X] | 3 | [Y] |
| **QA Escalations** | [X] | 3 | [Y] |

**Budget Category Definitions:**
- **Code Attempts:** Script execution attempts that fail and require a new versioned script
- **Subagent Re-invocations:** Times the orchestrator must re-invoke a subagent for the same phase (includes revision requests)
- **QA BLOCKER Revisions:** Script revisions triggered by code-reviewer BLOCKER findings (max 2 per script before escalation)
- **STOP Conditions:** Data-ingest agent STOP conditions triggered (file issues, data corruption, missing keys)
- **QA Escalations:** Incremented when a QA BLOCKER remains unresolved after the maximum revision attempts (2 per script) and must be escalated to the user for resolution

> **Budget asymmetry:** Session limits are deliberately lower than per-part × 4 to prevent error concentration. A session consuming full per-part budgets in every part indicates systemic issues warranting user intervention.

> **Multi-file scaling (HIERARCHICAL only):** For HIERARCHICAL profiling with N files, per-part code attempt limits scale to 2×N (e.g., 2 files = 4 attempts per part, 3 files = 6 per part). Session limits scale proportionally but are capped at 2× the single-file session limit. If a single file consistently fails while others succeed, consider profiling it independently rather than exhausting the budget.

### Resumption Instructions (Agent Reference)

**For the orchestrator when recovering via Session Recovery:**

1. **Read this STATE.md first** — primary recovery document
2. **Review User Request and Data Source Info** for original scope and provenance
3. **Check Profiling Progress table** for current part and script status
4. **Check Interpretation Tracking** if past Part D (user decisions must be preserved)
5. **Current Phase:** [DI-N] — [Phase Name]
6. **Next Task:** `[task or script description]`

**Quick Resume Checklist:**
- [ ] STATE.md read and understood (position, checkpoints, blockers)
- [ ] Profiling Progress table reviewed (which scripts done/pending/skipped)
- [ ] Interpretation Tracking reviewed (if past PSU-DI2)
- [ ] User Request and Data Source Info reviewed
- [ ] Open blockers identified
- [ ] Next action ready for execution
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create

Create STATE.md at **Stage DI-2 (Project Setup)** for all Data Onboarding Mode sessions.

### When to Update

**Authoritative cycle:** The Per-Part Execution Cycle in `data-onboarding-mode.md` defines the mandatory STATE.md read/write rhythm for profiling parts DI-3 through DI-6. The list below enumerates the specific trigger events; the STATE.md Update Gates table in `data-onboarding-mode.md` maps each event to the exact fields that must be updated.

Update STATE.md after:
- Each profiling script executes (update Profiling Progress row)
- Each part QA completes (update Checkpoint Status + QA Findings)
- PSU-DI1 presented (update Current Position)
- PSU-DI2 user response received (populate Interpretation Tracking)
- Skill authoring completes (update Skill Authoring Status)
- Key decisions are made
- Blockers are encountered
- Error budget is consumed
- Before any planned break
- Learning signals received from subagents

### Minimal Update Pattern

For quick updates during execution:

```markdown
**Last Updated:** [timestamp]
**Current Stage:** [DI-N]
**Last Script:** [script name] - [DONE/FAILED]
**Next Action:** [description]
```

### Full Update Pattern

Use full template update:
- At end of each profiling part (A, B, C, D)
- When blockers encountered
- Before session breaks
- After PSU-DI2 user review

---

## Integration with Session Recovery

STATE.md is the primary input for session recovery:

1. **Recovery starts** with reading STATE.md
2. **Profiling Progress** shows exactly which scripts completed
3. **Interpretation Tracking** preserves user decisions from PSU-DI2
4. **Next actions** provide immediate guidance
5. **Skill Authoring Status** shows whether skill creation has begun

See `{BASE_DIR}/.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/references/session-recovery.md` for the complete recovery procedure.

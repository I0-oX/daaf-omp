# Data Source Skill Template

This document defines the **canonical structure** for all `*-data-source-*` skills. Every data source skill MUST follow this section order and formatting. The template ensures consistent subagent consumption, predictable section locations, and uniform quality across all 14+ data source skills.

**Audience:** Skill authors and agents performing skill maintenance.

---

## How to Use This Template

1. **New skills:** Copy the skeleton below, fill in source-specific content
2. **Existing skills:** Restructure to match the canonical section order — preserve all content, only reorganize
3. **Key rule:** No information loss during restructuring. Source-specific sections (e.g., CCD's "Grade -1 Encoding", EDFacts' "Cross-State Comparison" warning) become subsections within the standardized structure

---

## Canonical Section Order (MANDATORY)

Every data source SKILL.md MUST contain these sections in this exact order:

```
 1. Frontmatter (YAML)
 2. Title
 3. Summary paragraph
 4. Value Encodings Warnings (blockquote)
 5. ## What is [Source]?
 6. ## Reference File Structure
 7. ## Decision Trees
 8. ## Quick Reference: [Source-Specific]
 9. ## Data Access
10. ## Common Pitfalls
11. ## Related Data Sources
12. ## Topic Index
```

Optional sections (insert between 10 and 11 if needed):
- `## Limitations` — only if content doesn't fit naturally in Common Pitfalls
- `## Common Use Cases` — if the source has distinct research applications worth enumerating
- `## [Source-Specific Critical Section]` — e.g., EDFacts' cross-state warning, Scorecard's Title IV limitation
- `## Multi-File Structure` — for HIERARCHICAL data sources with multiple related files (see Section 11.5 in the annotated skeleton)
- `## Survey Design` — for data sources that are complex probability surveys (not censuses or admin data). Include: design type (stratified, clustered, multistage), weight variable names and when to use each, strata and PSU variable names, replicate weight information (type, count, Fay coefficient if BRR), recommended variance estimation method, and a pointer to load the `svy` skill for implementation syntax and `data-scientist/references/survey-analysis.md` for methodology. See ECLS-K, HSLS:09, ACS PUMS, CPS, NHANES, and MEPS as examples of sources requiring this section.

> **Section numbering note:** The annotated skeleton below numbers optional sections as 11 and 11.5, which shifts Related Data Sources and Topic Index to positions 12 and 13 in the skeleton. The **canonical count is 12 mandatory sections** (numbered 1–12 in the list above). In the final generated skill, if no optional sections are used, Related Data Sources is the 11th section and Topic Index is the 12th. The skeleton's higher numbers are an annotation artifact, not a different count.

---

## Annotated Skeleton

Everything below this line is the template. Annotations appear in `<!-- HTML comments -->` and should be removed in the final skill. Placeholder tokens appear in `[BRACKETS]` and must be replaced.

---

### Section 1: Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: *-data-source-[acronym]
description: >-
  [ACRONYM] — [what it is] ([coverage], [year range]). [Key content areas].
  Use for [triggers]. [Critical constraint or disambiguation].
metadata:
  audience: any-agent
  domain: data-source
  skill-authored: "YYYY-MM-DD"      # Date this skill was first created
  skill-last-updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # Date this skill was last updated or re-verified
---
```

<!-- RULES:
  - name: must match the directory name exactly
  - NAMING CONVENTION: {content-domain}-data-source-{acronym}
    - {content-domain} groups related sources by subject area (education, election, health)
    - This is distinct from metadata.domain which categorizes the functional type ("data-source")
    - {acronym} is the standard abbreviation (CCD, IPEDS, CRDC) — not the full name
    - Examples: education-data-source-ccd, election-data-source-countypres
    - When a source has multiple tables, append a table identifier
      (e.g., education-data-source-ccd-schools)
  - description: ≤1,024 chars (validation limit). Write a complete, information-rich
    description — this is the only text agents see when deciding whether to load the
    skill. Longer is allowed but not always better: 40+ DAAF skills share an aggregate
    skill-listing budget (~1% of the context window), and when it overflows, descriptions
    for the least-invoked skills are dropped first. Spend characters on triggering
    accuracy and critical caveats, not exhaustive content inventories.
    (Display: the listing truncates the combined description + when_to_use at 1,536
    chars — raised from 250 in OMP v2.1.105; configurable via
    maxSkillDescriptionChars, so verify if truncation behavior seems off.)
  - description: no angle brackets (< >)
  - description: MUST include both "what it does" AND "when to use it"
  - description: MUST include approximate year coverage for the source (e.g., "2009-2022")
  - description: Front-load the source identity (acronym + what it is), NOT skill-document
    framing — write "CCD — federal universe of all U.S. public K-12 schools..."
    not "Deep reference for the Common Core of Data (CCD)..."
  - description: Include Portal-specific data scope when it differs from the full source
    (e.g., "Portal: 7 columns only")
  - description: Include key disambiguation (what NOT to use this for)
  - FULL DESCRIPTION: Write an expanded body description as a plain paragraph after
    the # Title heading — it elaborates beyond the frontmatter (expanded scope,
    additional triggers, detailed disambiguation) rather than duplicating it, and is
    the natural home for detail that doesn't earn its place in the shared listing
    budget. It is visible once the skill is loaded but does NOT influence triggering.
  - domain: ALWAYS use "data-source" for all data source skills
  - audience: ALWAYS use "any-agent" for data source skills
  - PROVENANCE (REQUIRED for all data source skills — stored as metadata keys):
    - skill-authored: ISO-8601 date when the skill was first created (never changes)
    - skill-last-updated: ISO-8601 date when the skill was last updated or re-verified
    - On updates: change skill-last-updated only; skill-authored remains fixed
    - STALENESS: If skill-last-updated is more than a few months old, treat skill
      claims with caution — data sources evolve and skill documentation may have drifted
-->

---

### Section 2: Title

```markdown
# [ACRONYM] Data Source Reference
```

<!-- RULES:
  - Format: "# [ACRONYM] Data Source Reference"
  - Examples: "# CCD Data Source Reference", "# IPEDS Data Source Reference"
  - NOT: "Education Data Source: [Name]", "[Name] Source Guide", "[Acronym]: [Full Name]"
  - Use the standard acronym, not the full name
-->

---

### Section 3: Full Description + Summary

```markdown
[Full description paragraph — the complete, detailed description, expanded from
the frontmatter description. Includes all capabilities, specific triggers, scope
limitations, and disambiguation. This is what agents see once the skill is loaded.]

[Optional: One additional sentence describing the source's unique value proposition
— what this source provides that others don't. Only needed if the full description
above doesn't already convey this.]
```

<!-- RULES:
  - FIRST PARAGRAPH (required): The full description, expanded beyond the frontmatter.
    Contains detail deliberately left out of the shared listing budget: expanded scope,
    additional triggers, detailed disambiguation, year coverage details, key caveats.
    Written as a plain paragraph (no heading, no blockquote) immediately after # Title.
  - SECOND PARAGRAPH (optional): Additional unique value proposition if needed.
  - Do NOT simply duplicate the frontmatter description — expand and elaborate.
  - Total: aim for 2-5 sentences (~400-1,000 chars) across both paragraphs.
-->

---

### Section 4: Value Encodings Warnings (MANDATORY)

```markdown
> **CRITICAL: Value Encoding**
>
> Many data sources use **integer codes** for categorical variables, and some
> re-processed/cleaned datasets may adjust these in such a way that they
> differ from the [original source]'s [string codes / raw file formats].
> Always verify codes against codebooks whenever possible.
>
> | Context | [Example Field 1] | [Example Field 2] | [Example Field 3] |
> |---------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
> | **Current source** | `[value]` | `[value]` | `[value]` |
> | [Original source] | `[value]` | `[value]` | `[value]` |
>
> See `./references/variable-definitions.md` for complete encoding tables.
```

<!-- RULES:
  - MANDATORY for every skill — no exceptions
  - MUST appear here (after summary, before "What is" section)
  - Include a comparison table showing at least 2-3 example encodings
  - Reference the variable-definitions.md file for complete mappings
  - If the source uses nulls instead of -1/-2/-3 codes, note that here
  - Do NOT place Truth Hierarchy here — it belongs in Section 9 (Data Access)
-->

---

### Section 4.5: Staleness Warning

> **Note:** This warning is NOT a separate section in the generated SKILL.md.
> It is guidance for agents and humans consuming the skill. The provenance
> metadata keys (`skill-authored`, `skill-last-updated`) are sufficient — this rule governs interpretation.

**Rule:** If `skill-last-updated` is **more than a few months old**, treat the
skill's claims about column definitions, coded values, suppression patterns,
and data quality with caution. Data sources evolve — new years are added,
schemas change, coded values are revised, and suppression thresholds shift.
When in doubt, re-run data-ingest to re-verify against fresh data.

---

### Section 5: What is [Source]?

```markdown
## What is [Source Full Name]?

[Optional 1-sentence intro if needed for context.]

- **[Attribute 1]**: [Value] (e.g., "Collector: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)")
- **[Attribute 2]**: [Value] (e.g., "Coverage: ~100,000 public schools nationwide")
- **[Attribute 3]**: [Value] (e.g., "Frequency: Annual collection")
- **[Attribute 4]**: [Value] (e.g., "Available years: 1986-present")
- **[Attribute 5]**: [Value] (e.g., "Primary identifier: NCESSCH (12-digit school ID)")
```

<!-- RULES:
  - Use a bullet list with bold attribute keys
  - Include at minimum: who collects it, what it covers, coverage scope,
    frequency, available years, and primary identifier
  - NOT paragraphs, NOT numbered lists, NOT subsections
  - Keep to 5-8 bullets max
-->

---

### Section 6: Reference File Structure

```markdown
## Reference File Structure

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `[filename].md` | [What this file covers] | [Trigger: when would an agent need this] |
| `[filename].md` | [What this file covers] | [Trigger] |
| `variable-definitions.md` | Key variables, codes, special values | Interpreting specific data elements |
| `data-quality.md` | Known issues, suppression, limitations | Assessing data reliability |
```

<!-- RULES:
  - MUST be a 3-column table: File | Purpose | When to Read
  - Every skill should have at minimum: variable-definitions.md, data-quality.md, and analytical-context.md
  - File paths use backtick formatting
  - "When to Read" should be action-oriented (e.g., "Working with enrollment data")
-->

---

### Section 7: Decision Trees

```markdown
## Decision Trees

### [Primary decision tree title — e.g., "What data do I need?"]

```
[Research question or task]?
├─ [Option A] → ./references/[file].md
│   └─ [Sub-option] → ./references/[file].md#[section]
├─ [Option B] → ./references/[file].md
└─ [Option C] → ./references/[file].md
```

### [Secondary decision tree — e.g., "Is this a data quality issue?"]

```
[Situation]?
├─ [Scenario A] → [Action/Reference]
├─ [Scenario B] → [Action/Reference]
└─ [Scenario C] → [Action/Reference]
```
```

<!-- RULES:
  - Use ASCII tree diagrams inside code blocks
  - Include at least 2 decision trees (primary navigation + quality/validity check)
  - Leaf nodes should point to specific reference files or sections
  - Trees should cover the most common agent decision points for this source
-->

---

### Section 8: Quick Reference

```markdown
## Quick Reference: [Primary Domain Tables]

### [Source-Specific Subsection — e.g., "Key Variables", "Survey Components"]

| [Column 1] | [Column 2] | [Column 3] |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| [data] | [data] | [data] |

### Key Identifiers

| ID | Format | Level | Example | Notes |
|----|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| `[id_field]` | [format] | [School/District/Institution] | `[example]` | [notes] |

### Missing Data Codes

| Code | Meaning | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `-1` | Missing | Data not reported |
| `-2` | Not applicable | Item doesn't apply to this entity |
| `-3` | Suppressed | Data suppressed for privacy |
| `null` | Not available | [If source uses nulls instead of/in addition to codes] |

### [Additional Source-Specific Subsections as needed]
```

<!-- RULES:
  - Section title: "## Quick Reference: [Descriptive Label]"
  - MUST include a "### Missing Data Codes" subsection (even if brief)
  - MUST include a "### Key Identifiers" subsection if the source has join keys
  - Source-specific content goes in additional ### subsections
  - Use tables for all quick-lookup content
  - Include categorical code tables here (race codes, type codes, etc.)
  - Source-critical warnings (e.g., CCD grade -1, IPEDS no inst_level 3)
    become ### subsections within Quick Reference
-->

---

### Section 9: Data Access

```markdown
## Data Access

### Dataset Paths

| Topic | Type | Path |
|-------|------|------|
| [Dataset name] | [Single/Yearly] | `[path/to/file]` |
| [Dataset name] | [Single/Yearly] | `[path/to/file_{year}]` |

### Codebooks

| Dataset | Codebook Path |
|---------|---------------|
| [Dataset name] | `[path/to/codebook_name]` |

> Codebooks are `.xls` files on both mirrors. See `datasets-reference.md` for the
> full catalog and `fetch-patterns.md` for `get_codebook_url()`. For human
> reference — not parsed programmatically.

### Example Fetch

```python
# Uses fetch_from_mirrors() from fetch-patterns.md — tries each mirror
# in priority order per mirrors.yaml and applies filters locally.
from fetch_utils import fetch_from_mirrors

df = fetch_from_mirrors(
    "[source]/[dataset_path]",
    filters={"fips": 6},  # California
    years=[[year]],
)
```

### Filtering

```python
# [Source-specific filtering examples]
# Show 2-3 common filter patterns relevant to this source
```
```

<!-- RULES:
  - Section name: ALWAYS "## Data Access" (not "Data Fetching", "API Gotchas", etc.)
  - TWO ACCESS MODELS: Choose the appropriate skeleton based on how the data is accessed:
    - MIRROR-BASED: Use the skeleton above (Dataset Paths, Codebooks, Example Fetch, Filtering)
    - API-BASED: Use the alternative skeleton below (Prerequisites, Dataset Endpoints,
      Example Fetch with API pattern, Data Persistence, Filtering)
    - A skill may include BOTH if the data is available through mirrors AND an API
  - MIRROR-BASED RULES:
    - MUST have all four subsections: Dataset Paths, Codebooks, Example Fetch, Filtering
    - Dataset Paths table: 3 columns (Topic | Type | Path) — canonical paths from datasets-reference.md
    - Codebooks table: 2 columns (Dataset | Codebook Path) + standard blockquote note
    - Example Fetch: ALWAYS use fetch_from_mirrors() pattern from fetch-patterns.md
    - Example Fetch: Include at least one filter (fips + year is the standard pattern)
  - API-BASED RULES:
    - MUST have Prerequisites subsection if authentication is required
    - MUST have Example Fetch using os.environ for API key (NEVER hardcode keys)
    - MUST have Data Persistence subsection documenting both local-storage and
      live-query patterns when the source supports API access
    - The election-data-source-countypres skill is the reference implementation
      for the API access pattern
  - COMMON RULES (both models):
    - Filtering subsection: Show source-specific filter patterns
    - The Filtering subsection can be omitted ONLY if Example Fetch already shows
      all common filter patterns (to avoid redundancy)
    - MUST include Truth Hierarchy blockquote in this section (after Codebooks/Endpoints,
      before Example Fetch). This is the CANONICAL location for Truth Hierarchy across
      all skills. Use this exact format:
        > **Truth Hierarchy:** When interpreting variable values, apply this priority:
        > 1. **Actual data file** (what you observe in the parquet/CSV) — this IS the truth
        > 2. **Live codebook** (.xls in mirror) — authoritative documentation, may lag
        > 3. **This skill documentation** — convenient summary, may drift from codebook
        >
        > If this documentation contradicts the codebook, trust the codebook.
        > If the codebook contradicts observed data, trust the data and investigate.
-->

#### Alternative Skeleton: API-Based Data Access

Use this skeleton instead of (or in addition to) the mirror-based skeleton above when the data source is accessed via API:

```markdown
## Data Access

### Prerequisites

> **API Key Required:** This data source requires authentication.
> Add `[ENV_VAR_NAME]=your_key_here` to the `environment_settings.txt` file in your `daaf-docker/` folder
> (copy `environment_settings_example.txt` to `environment_settings.txt` if you haven't already), then recreate the container: `docker compose down` followed by `run_daaf`.
> See the [Installation Guide — Set up data source API keys](../user_reference/01_installation_and_quickstart.md#set-up-data-source-api-keys) for setup instructions.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Environment variable | `[ENV_VAR_NAME]` |
| Where to get a key | [URL + brief instructions] |
| Rate limits | [if known, or "Unknown"] |

### Dataset Endpoints

| Dataset | Endpoint / DOI | Format | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| [name] | [URL or DOI] | [TSV/JSON/CSV/Parquet] | [notes] |

> **Truth Hierarchy:** When interpreting variable values, apply this priority:
> 1. **Actual data file** (what you observe in the downloaded data) — this IS the truth
> 2. **API documentation / codebook** — authoritative, may lag behind actual data
> 3. **This skill documentation** — convenient summary, may drift from source docs
>
> If this documentation contradicts the API docs, trust the API docs.
> If the API docs contradict observed data, trust the data and investigate.

### Example Fetch

```python
import os, io, requests
import polars as pl

# --- Config ---
API_KEY = os.environ["[ENV_VAR_NAME]"]
ENDPOINT = "[base_url/endpoint]"

# --- Fetch ---
# INTENT: Download [dataset] via [API name]
# ASSUMES: API key is set in environment
r = requests.get(ENDPOINT, params={"key": API_KEY})
r.raise_for_status()
df = pl.read_csv(io.BytesIO(r.content), separator="\t")

# --- Validate ---
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
assert df.shape[0] > 0, "STOP: Empty response from API"
```

### Data Persistence

**Local storage (download once, then use local file):**
```python
# Save to project data/raw/ after fetching
df.write_parquet(f"{DATA_DIR}/raw/{DATE}_{source}_{dataset}.parquet")
# Subsequent scripts load from local parquet — no API access needed
```

**Live query (fetch from API each time):**
```python
# Include the full API call pattern above in each Stage 5 script
# Data is always current but requires API access and a valid key
# Consider saving a local backup for offline use
```

### Filtering

```python
# [Source-specific filtering examples after download]
# All filtering is done locally with Polars after the API response is received
```
```

### Section 10: Common Pitfalls

```markdown
## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Issue | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| [Short name] | [What goes wrong] | [How to fix or avoid] |
| [Short name] | [What goes wrong] | [How to fix or avoid] |
| [Short name] | [What goes wrong] | [How to fix or avoid] |
```

<!-- RULES:
  - MUST be a 3-column table: Pitfall | Issue | Solution
  - NOT bullet lists, NOT "Do/Don't" format, NOT numbered lists
  - Include at minimum 3 pitfalls (every source has at least 3 gotchas)
  - Every skill should include "Using string codes" pitfall if applicable
  - Include source-specific pitfalls (e.g., CCD's FRPL, IPEDS' GASB/FASB)
  - If content currently exists as "Common Analysis Mistakes", "Important Caveats",
    etc., restructure into this table format
-->

---

### Section 11 (Optional): Additional Sections

```markdown
## [Source-Specific Critical Section]
```

<!-- RULES:
  - Place between Common Pitfalls and Related Data Sources
  - Use for content that doesn't fit naturally in other sections, such as:
    - EDFacts: "CRITICAL WARNING: Cross-State Comparisons" (with Valid/Invalid examples)
    - Scorecard: "Critical Limitation: Title IV Recipients Only"
    - Scorecard: "Comparison: Scorecard vs IPEDS"
    - CCD: "Coverage Notes" (What CCD Includes / Excludes)
    - MEPS: "Why MEPS Instead of FRPL?"
    - SAIPE: "Poverty Definition"
  - If a source has key comparison tables (e.g., PSEO vs Scorecard vs State Systems),
    place them here
  - This section is OPTIONAL — only use when content is critical and doesn't belong
    in Quick Reference or Common Pitfalls
-->

---

### Section 11.5 (Optional): Multi-File Structure

Use this section when the data source comprises multiple related files at different levels of aggregation (HIERARCHICAL file structure from Data Onboarding).

```markdown
## Multi-File Structure

> This data source comprises multiple related files at different levels
> of aggregation. Load the appropriate file(s) for your analysis level.

### Schema Map

| File / Table | Entity Type | Grain | Row Count | Key Column(s) |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| [file/table 1] | [e.g., Schools] | One row per school per year | [N] | `[key]` |
| [file/table 2] | [e.g., Districts] | One row per district per year | [N] | `[key]` |

### Entity Hierarchy

```
[Level 1: States]
    └─ [Level 2: Districts] (linked by state_fips)
        └─ [Level 3: Schools] (linked by leaid)
```

### Join Patterns

```python
# Join schools to districts
schools_with_district = schools.join(
    districts,
    on="leaid",
    how="left",
    suffix="_district"
)
# ASSUMES: leaid is present in both files
# WARNING: Check for leaid values in schools that have no district match
unmatched = schools_with_district.filter(pl.col("col_district").is_null()).shape[0]
print(f"Join coverage: {len(schools_with_district) - unmatched} / {len(schools_with_district)}")
```

### Cross-Level Caveats

| Caveat | Affected Levels | Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| [e.g., "Not all schools have district records"] | Schools → Districts | [X]% of school rows lose district data on join |
| [e.g., "District aggregates don't sum to state totals"] | Districts → States | State file uses independent estimates |
```

<!-- RULES:
  - ONLY include for sources with HIERARCHICAL file structure (multiple files
    at different aggregation levels)
  - Do NOT include for SINGLE or HORIZONTAL file structures
  - Schema Map MUST include all files/tables with grain description and key columns
  - Entity Hierarchy MUST use ASCII tree diagram showing parent-child relationships
  - Join Patterns MUST include working Polars code with:
    - Explicit join type (left, inner, etc.) with rationale
    - Validation check (count unmatched rows)
    - IAT comments (ASSUMES, WARNING)
  - Cross-Level Caveats MUST document known join issues discovered during profiling
    (from script 07b cross-level-linkage findings)
  - Place between Common Pitfalls / Additional Sections and Related Data Sources
-->

---

### Section 12: Related Data Sources

```markdown
## Related Data Sources

| Source | Relationship | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `[skill-name]` | [How it relates] | [When to use the other source instead/together] |
| `education-data-explorer` | Parent discovery skill | Finding available endpoints |
| `education-data-query` | Data fetching | Downloading parquet/CSV files |
```

<!-- RULES:
  - Section name: ALWAYS "## Related Data Sources"
  - NOT "Related Skills and Tools", "Cross-Reference to Related Skills", etc.
  - 3-column table: Source | Relationship | When to Use
  - ALWAYS include the domain's explorer and query skill rows (e.g., `education-data-explorer` and `education-data-query` for education). If no domain-specific explorer/query skills exist yet, note this (see countypres for example).
  - Include complementary data sources (e.g., CCD includes CRDC, SAIPE, MEPS)
  - Include join key information if relevant (e.g., "Join on unitid")
  - For sources with cross-domain join potential, include a worked Polars join
    example either in this section or with a pointer to analytical-context.md
    (see "Cross-Dataset Join Examples" in Reference File Density Guidelines)
-->

---

### Section 13: Topic Index

```markdown
## Topic Index

| Topic | Reference File |
|-------|---------------|
| [Topic name] | `./references/[file].md` |
| [Topic name] | `./references/[file].md` |
```

<!-- RULES:
  - MUST be the LAST section in the file
  - ALWAYS 2 columns: Topic | Reference File
  - NOT 3 columns (remove any "Section" column — e.g., CRDC currently has 3)
  - Reference file paths use backtick formatting with ./references/ prefix
  - Group related topics together (all topics from same file adjacent)
  - This is the comprehensive lookup table — every reference file topic should appear
-->

---

## Size Guidelines

**Line guidance:** Target 250-400 lines for SKILL.md. Skills over 500 lines should split content into reference files. This is a guideline, not a strict rule — clarity and completeness take priority over line count.

| Metric | Target | Hard Limit |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Total SKILL.md lines | 250-400 | 500 |
| Frontmatter description | 300-700 chars | **1,024 chars** (validation limit; the listing displays description + when_to_use combined up to 1,536 chars) |
| Body full description | 2-5 sentences (~400-1,000 chars) | No hard limit — should be at least as informative as the frontmatter description, adding detail omitted from the listing for budget economy |
| Decision trees | 2-4 trees | 6 trees |
| Quick Reference subsections | 3-6 | 10 |
| Common Pitfalls rows | 3-8 | 12 |
| Topic Index rows | 10-30 | 50 |

### Reference File Density Guidelines

Reference files are loaded on-demand (Level 3 progressive disclosure), meaning their token cost is only incurred when an agent actually needs that information. This makes them the ideal location for comprehensive, detailed documentation — the token budget pressure that applies to SKILL.md (which is loaded whenever the skill triggers) does NOT apply to reference files.

**Principle: SKILL.md is the concise navigation hub; reference files are the comprehensive knowledge base.**

| Metric | Target | Floor |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total reference file lines | 4-6x SKILL.md lines | 3x SKILL.md lines |
| columns.md lines per column | 3-5 lines | 2 lines |
| coded-values.md (or value-interpretation.md) | All coded values enumerated; see below for no-codes case | Top values only is insufficient |
| data-quality.md | All profiling anomalies cataloged | 150+ lines for complex sources |
| variable-definitions.md | Semantic families with examples | 150+ lines |
| analytical-context.md | Study design, exclusions, valid/invalid analyses | 200+ lines |
| Topic-specific files | 1 per major analytical domain (see Domain Assessment below) | At least 1 if source has 3+ distinct analytical use cases |

**Benchmark:** The hand-authored education data source skills average ~2,400 lines of reference content across 5-8 files, with individual files averaging ~370 lines and reference-to-SKILL ratios of 4-8×. Skills below 3× are likely under-documented. Skills authored by the data onboarding pipeline should aim toward this benchmark.

**Standard reference files for data source skills:**

| File | Content | Required? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `columns.md` | Full column definitions, types, null rates, value ranges | Yes |
| `coded-values.md` | All coded/sentinel value mappings | Yes (see note below for no-codes case) |
| `data-quality.md` | Anomalies, suppression, quality observations | Yes |
| `variable-definitions.md` | Semantic families, derived metrics, join guidance | Yes |
| `analytical-context.md` | Study design, population coverage (including exclusions), valid/invalid analyses, limitations by research context, alternative sources | Yes |
| Topic-specific files | Deep coverage of major analytical domains (see Domain Assessment below) | Yes, if source has 3+ distinct analytical use cases |

**No-codes case (`value-interpretation.md`):** If profiling confirms the dataset has NO coded or sentinel values (e.g., no -1/-2/-3 codes, no integer-encoded categoricals), create `value-interpretation.md` instead of `coded-values.md`. This file documents: (1) what negative values mean (substantive vs. error), (2) null/missing value semantics and patterns, (3) value range expectations by column family, (4) any unusual value patterns that could be mistaken for codes. The file remains required — it shifts from a code lookup table to a value semantics guide. Reference it as `value-interpretation.md` in the Reference File Structure table and Topic Index.

**What belongs in reference files (not SKILL.md):**
- Complete column-by-column documentation
- Full coded value enumeration tables
- Methodology explanations and limitations for specific analytical domains
- Worked examples showing valid vs. invalid analysis patterns
- Historical context (schema changes across years, policy transitions)
- Cross-source comparison guidance for related datasets
- Study/survey design context that researchers need for proper interpretation

### Domain Assessment

Before authoring reference files, identify the source's major analytical domains — the distinct research areas or methodological concerns that warrant dedicated documentation. Each domain that requires 50+ lines of explanation (methodology, limitations, valid/invalid usage) should get its own topic-specific reference file.

**How to identify domains:** Group the source's columns and documented use cases into clusters. For IPEDS, the domains are enrollment, graduation rates, finance, financial aid, completions, and institutional identifiers — each with distinct methodology, limitations, and pitfalls. For an election dataset, domains might be vote-share calculation, geographic aggregation, and voting-mode reconstruction. For a mobility dataset, domains might be the causal identification strategy, covariate structure, and shrinkage estimation.

**Rule:** If the source spans 3+ distinct analytical use cases, at least one topic-specific reference file is expected. Topic-specific files should be 40-60% interpretive — explaining *why* limitations exist and *how* they affect specific analyses (following the model of IPEDS `graduation-rates.md` or countypres `mode-reconstruction.md`), not merely listing column names.

| Source Complexity | Expected Topic-Specific Files | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Simple (1 table, <20 columns, 1-2 use cases) | 0 | SAIPE poverty estimates |
| Moderate (1-2 tables, 20-100 columns, 3-4 use cases) | 1-2 | Election returns, MEPS |
| Complex (multiple tables/components, 100+ columns, 5+ use cases) | 3-6 | IPEDS, CCD |

### Provenance Scripts

Data source skills may include a `scripts/` subdirectory containing the profiling scripts that generated the reference file content. These are not loaded by agents but provide provenance and reproducibility — if the source data updates, the profiling scripts can be re-run to verify or update the skill. Skills created via Data Onboarding should always bundle their profiling scripts.

### Cross-Dataset Join Examples

When a data source shares join keys with other DAAF data source skills (e.g., county FIPS, unitid, state codes), the Related Data Sources section or `analytical-context.md` should include worked Polars join examples with actual column names, explicit join type, and a validation check. This is especially valuable for cross-domain joins (e.g., election data joined to education data via county FIPS) where the column names and formats may differ between sources.

### Temporal and Historical Documentation

All data source skills should document temporal scope in `analytical-context.md` or a dedicated `temporal-coverage.md`/`historical-changes.md` file:
- **Cross-sectional data:** What historical moment does this represent? What cohorts or time periods? What is NOT covered temporally?
- **Longitudinal data:** Are there schema changes, methodology breaks, or coverage gaps across years? Document explicit "DO NOT compare across this boundary" guidance with the year and nature of the break (following the education skills' `historical-changes.md` pattern).
- **All sources:** What temporal resolution is available (annual, biennial, one-time)? If the data could be confused with more recent or more frequent data, flag this prominently.

**Content quality target:** Reference files should be approximately 40-60% interpretive/
analytical guidance (why limitations exist, how they affect specific analyses, what
alternatives exist, when comparisons are valid vs invalid) and 40-60% factual data
description (code tables, column definitions, value enumerations). Avoid reference files
that are purely factual data dumps — these are less useful than the raw data itself.

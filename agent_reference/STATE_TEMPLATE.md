# STATE.md Template

This template defines the session state file used for persistent memory across context windows and session recovery.

---

## Template

Copy this template to `STATE.md` in the project folder when starting a Full Pipeline analysis.

```markdown
# Session State: [Project Title]

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Session Count:** [N]

---

## Current Position

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Project** | [Full title] |
| **Plan Location** | `research/[folder]/[filename]_Plan.md` |
| **Plan Tasks Location** | `research/[folder]/[filename]_Plan_Tasks.md` |
| **Current Phase** | [1-5]: [Phase Name] |

## Session Metadata

> Captured at project setup for AI use disclosure (see `agent_reference/AI_DISCLOSURE_REFERENCE.md`). The orchestrator populates these fields when creating STATE.md.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **DAAF Version** | [Short git commit hash — from `git rev-parse --short HEAD` at project setup] |
| **Session Model ID** | [Model identifier driving the orchestrator/main session at session start — record the runtime value, not this example (e.g., "claude-opus-4-8[1m]")] |
| **Subagent Model Tiers** | [Distinct specialist model IDs by tier, from agent frontmatter defaults (`model: opus` / `model: sonnet`) plus any per-dispatch overrides the orchestrator applied. Record resolved IDs where known, or the tier alias + session date otherwise — e.g., "opus tier: claude-opus-4-8[1m]; sonnet tier: claude-sonnet-4-5". See `.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/SKILL.md` > "Model Selection for Subagent Dispatch" and AI_DISCLOSURE_REFERENCE.md > Multi-Model Sessions.] |
| **Session Date(s)** | [Date(s) of analysis sessions — e.g., "2026-02-11"] |
| **Session Transcript(s)** | `logs/` — collected at project completion via `collect_session_logs.sh` |

| CP3 (Post-Transform) | [PENDING/PASSED/FAILED] | [time] | [notes] |
| CP4 (Pre-Output) | [PENDING/PASSED/FAILED] | [time] | [notes] |

### Secondary Validation (QA1-QA4b)

| Checkpoint | Stage | Status | BLOCKERs | WARNINGs | Revisions | Timestamp |
|------------|-------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| QA1 (Post-Fetch) | 5 | [PENDING/PASSED/ISSUES] | [count] | [count] | [count] | [time] |
| QA2 (Post-Clean) | 6 | [PENDING/PASSED/ISSUES] | [count] | [count] | [count] | [time] |

- **PASSED** — All scripts passed QA review (no BLOCKERs, WARNINGs logged)
- **ISSUES** — BLOCKERs resolved via revision, or WARNINGs logged

**Note:** This table provides an aggregate summary per stage. Per-script QA tracking (which gates individual script progression) is recorded in the **Transformation Progress** table below, where each row tracks one script's independent QA status.

## Discovery Preliminary Notes

> Orchestrator writes lossless agent findings to disk as preliminary notes files
> immediately upon receiving each discovery-phase agent's return. These files
> persist the full agent output (zero compression) and are referenced by
> downstream agents (data-planner, plan-checker, data-verifier) for full-fidelity
> access to discovery findings. Gate conditions prevent downstream stages from
> proceeding until the relevant files exist on disk.

| Stage | Agent | File Path | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 2 | search-agent | `output/preliminary_notes/{date}_stage2_data-exploration.md` | [PENDING/WRITTEN] |
| 3 | source-researcher | `output/preliminary_notes/{date}_stage3_{source}_source-research.md` | [PENDING/WRITTEN] |
| 3.5 | research-synthesizer | `output/preliminary_notes/{date}_stage3.5_research-synthesis.md` | [PENDING/WRITTEN] |

**Status Values:**
- **PENDING** — Agent not yet dispatched or return not yet persisted
- **WRITTEN** — File exists on disk with full lossless agent return

**Note:** Add one row per source-researcher dispatch (one per data source). All rows must show WRITTEN before Stage 4 can proceed.

> Orchestrator populates this section after each Stage 6, 7, and 8 script completion,
> extracting citation data from research-executor output. The report-writer reads this
> as the primary source for the report's References section.

### Context Snapshot

**Orchestrator Utilization:** [actual % from context-reporter hook, e.g., "125k / 1000k tokens (12%)"]

**Key Findings Summary (max 5 bullets):**
- [Critical finding 1]
- [Critical finding 2]
- [Critical finding 3]

**Open Questions:**
- [Question awaiting resolution, or "None"]

**Pending User Decisions:**
- [Decision needed, or "None"]

### User Restart Prompt

**To resume in a new session, run `/clear` to reset context, then paste this into the chat:**

> Resume the [Project Title] analysis. Plan: `[exact plan path]`. Plan Tasks: `[exact Plan_Tasks path]`. State: `[exact STATE.md path]`. Currently at Stage [N] ([Stage Name]) — next step is [task description].

**Orchestrator:** Update this prompt whenever hitting the HIGH or CRITICAL utilization gates (see AGENTS.md § Context Quality Curve for the model-family thresholds), before planned session breaks, or when the user decides to stop. Use concrete values — no brackets or placeholders in the actual prompt.

### Resumption Instructions (Agent Reference)

**For the orchestrator when recovering via Session Recovery:**

1. **Read this STATE.md first** — This is the primary recovery document
2. **Locate Plan at:** `[exact path]` and Plan Tasks at: `[exact Plan_Tasks path]`
3. **Read Plan SELECTIVELY** — Search for `## ` headings, then load only:
   - **Always:** Original Request, Goal & Context, Decisions Log, Risk Register, Current Status
   - **Stage-conditional:** See Session Recovery Step 3c table for additional sections based on current stage
   - **On-demand:** Load specific wave task blocks only when dispatching (see Session Recovery "On-Demand Plan Loading")
4. **Current Phase:** [N] — [Phase Name]
5. **Current Stage:** [N] — [Stage Name]
6. **Next Task:** `[task-name]` (Wave [N])
7. **Required Plan Sections for Next Task:** [List the specific Plan sections needed — e.g., "Wave 5 task block from Executable Task Sequence, CP4 from Validation Checkpoints"]
8. **Prior Findings to Review:** [Specific findings or "See Context Snapshot above"]

**Quick Resume Checklist:**
- [ ] STATE.md read and understood (position, checkpoints, blockers, next actions, context snapshot)
- [ ] Plan recovery sections loaded selectively (NOT entire Plan)
- [ ] Stage-conditional sections loaded if applicable
- [ ] Open blockers identified
- [ ] Next task ready for execution (wave task block loaded on-demand when dispatching)
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create

Create STATE.md at **Stage 4 (Plan Creation)** for any analysis expected to:
- Span multiple sessions
- Involve complex multi-stage transformations
- Have elevated risk of context exhaustion
- Require collaboration or handoff

### When to Update

Update STATE.md after:
- Each checkpoint passes (CP1-CP4)
- Each stage completes
- Key decisions are made
- Blockers are encountered
- Error budget is consumed
- Deviations are applied
- Before any planned break
- Learning signals received from subagents (append to Pending buffer)
- Flush triggers met (flush buffer → LEARNINGS.md)
- Citations extracted from research-executor output (append to Citations Accumulated)
- QA findings reported by code-reviewer (append to QA Findings Summary)
- Runtime risks discovered (append to Runtime Risks)
- Stage 10 QA aggregation (finalize QA Findings Summary)
- Stage 12 final review (populate Final Review Log)

### Minimal Update Pattern

For quick updates during execution:

```markdown
**Last Updated:** [timestamp]
**Current Stage:** [N]
**Last Checkpoint:** [CPn] - [PASSED]
**Next Action:** [description]
```

### Full Update Pattern

Use full template update:
- At end of each phase
- When blockers encountered
- Before session breaks
- When resuming after interruption

---

## Integration with Session Recovery

STATE.md is the primary input for the Session Recovery procedure:

1. **Recovery starts** with reading STATE.md
2. **Current position** tells where to resume
3. **Checkpoint status** shows what's validated
4. **Next actions** provide immediate guidance
5. **Blockers** surface issues needing resolution
6. **Error budget** prevents infinite retries

See `{BASE_DIR}/.omp/skills/daaf-orchestrator/references/session-recovery.md` for complete recovery procedure.

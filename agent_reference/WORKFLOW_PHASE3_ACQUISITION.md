# Workflow Reference: Phase 3 — Data Acquisition & Preparation

Stages 5, 6. Cross-phase orchestration guidance (invocation templates, QA protocols, context requirements) is in `full-pipeline-mode.md`.

**Execution Model:** All scripts follow the file-first execution pattern. See `SCRIPT_EXECUTION_REFERENCE.md` for the complete protocol.

> **Async dispatch note.** This phase runs strictly one script at a time (each fetch or clean, then its mandatory code-reviewer QA, before the next). Under async dispatch, each research-executor and code-reviewer returns via a completion notification rather than a synchronous tool return. Do not start the next script, evaluate a stage gate (G5, G6), or present PSU3 until the current dispatch's return has arrived and been fully processed. If more than one dispatch is ever in flight at once, treat every mid-flight notification as status-only and wait for all of them before acting.

## Stage 5: Data Retrieval

**Executor:** Subagent (general-purpose)
**Skill:** Domain query skill (e.g., `education-data-query`)
**Purpose:** Fetch data from configured data mirrors

**Note:** Uses `general-purpose` subagent type (not `Plan`) because it must save data files to `data/raw/`.

### Actions

1. **Construct Query**
   - Build data access URL from Plan.md specification
   - Construct necessary sample filters (year, subgroups, etc.)

2. **Execute Query**
   - Implement timeout handling for mirror downloads
   - Retry on transient errors

3. **Validate Response**
   - Check shape
   - Verify columns
   - Confirm year coverage
   - Confirm subsample specifications

4. **Save Data**
   - Parquet format (for processing)
   - Location: `data/raw/`

5. **>>> INVOKE code-reviewer (MANDATORY) <<<**
   - After research-executor completes, orchestrator MUST invoke code-reviewer
   - Pass: script path, output files, Plan.md + Plan_Tasks.md locations
   - Wait for QA result before proceeding to Stage 6
   - If BLOCKER: trigger revision flow (max 2 attempts)
   - If WARNING: log to STATE.md, proceed
   - If PASSED: proceed to Stage 6

### Thoroughness Directive

```
- Download complete file from mirror
- Validate response shape immediately
- Save ONLY in parquet format
- Document any data access issues encountered
```

### Invocation Template: Domain Query Skill

**Purpose:** Download data from mirrors
**Stage:** 5 (Data Retrieval)
**Subagent:** general-purpose
**Skills:** `data-scientist`, `{domain_query_skill}`

> **Domain extensibility:** The orchestrator resolves the query skill name based on the active domain (from the Plan's Domain Configuration) and provides it in the Agent prompt. The example below uses `education-data-query` as the demonstration domain default.

```python
task({
    description: "Stage 5: Data Retrieval",
    prompt: """**BASE_DIR:** {BASE_DIR}
All relative paths in referenced files resolve from BASE_DIR.

Call the skill tool with name '{domain_query_skill}'.  # e.g., 'education-data-query'
If user has R/Stata background, also include: "User has [R/Stata] background. Load [r-python-translation/stata-python-translation] skill. Add inline [R/Stata]-equivalent comments for non-trivial data operations."

**QUERY SPECIFICATION:**
- Dataset Path: {dataset_path}  (from datasets-reference.md, flat format e.g. "ccd/schools_ccd_directory")
- Years: {years}
- Filters: {filters}
- Variables: {variables}
- Expected Records: ~{expected_count}

**DATA OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Save to: data/raw/{date_prefix}_{source}_{description}.parquet

**RISK REGISTER ITEMS FOR THIS TASK:**
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Watch For |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| {risk_name} | {L/M/H} | {L/M/H} | {specific_action} | {symptom_to_monitor} |

During execution, ACTIVELY MONITOR for watch-for symptoms. Escalate if detected.

**CODED VALUE EXPECTATIONS:**
Retrieved data may include domain-specific coded missing values (per Plan Domain Configuration; e.g., -1, -2, -3 for education).
These will be handled in Stage 6. Report presence in CP1 output.

**MIRROR FETCH PROTOCOL (MANDATORY):**
Use the mirror-based fetch pattern from the education-data-query skill:
1. Try each mirror in priority order (per mirrors.yaml)
2. Build URLs from each mirror's url_template + dataset path parameters
3. Read using mirror's read_strategy; fall through on 404/timeout
4. Apply year/state/other filters locally with Polars
5. Log which mirror was used and the fetch result

**THOROUGHNESS DIRECTIVE:**
- Try each mirror in priority order
- Handle mirror failures with fallback
- Validate response shape immediately after fetch
- Document which mirror was used
- Verify all requested years are present
- Verify all requested columns are present

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return findings using the Research Executor Output Format
(see your agent protocol, § Output Format).

**Emphasis for this invocation:**
- File locations (parquet paths in `data/raw/`), mirror used, and any fallback events
- Row counts, column lists, year coverage, and CP1 validation status
- Initial data quality observations (missingness, coded values present)""",
    subagent_type: "research-executor"
})
```

### QA Follow-Up (MANDATORY)

**After research-executor completes EACH individual Stage 5 fetch script, orchestrator MUST immediately invoke code-reviewer to separately review that script.**
Use the **code-reviewer invocation template** from `full-pipeline-mode.md`
with stage-specific values for Stage 5.

**Do NOT start the next Stage 5 script until QA returns PASSED or WARNING for the current script.**
**Do NOT proceed to Stage 6 until ALL Stage 5 scripts have been individually QA'd.**

### Validation (CP1)

```python
# Required checks
assert len(df) > 0, "STOP: Empty dataset"
assert all(col in df.columns for col in required_cols), "STOP: Missing columns"
assert df['year'].is_in(expected_years).all(), "WARNING: Unexpected years"
```

### Output Format

```markdown
### Fetch Summary:
- Endpoint: [URL]
- Records retrieved: [count]
- Columns: [list]
- Years present: [list]
- Data access issues: [any problems]

### Initial Validation (CP1):
- Shape: [rows x cols]
- Missing values: [summary]
- Unexpected values: [any anomalies]
- **CP1 Status:** [PASSED | FAILED]

### File Locations:

### Scripts Saved (one per fetch task):
- Path: `scripts/stage5_fetch/{step}_{task-name}.py`
- Includes: Pagination handling, CP1 validation, output paths
- Note: Each fetch task produces a separate script; QA is invoked immediately after each
```

---

## Stage 6: Context Application

**Executor:** Subagent (general-purpose)
**Skill:** Domain context skill (e.g., `education-data-context`)
**Purpose:** Apply source-specific cleaning and context

**Note:** Uses `general-purpose` subagent type (not `Plan`) because it must save cleaned data files to `data/processed/`.

### Actions

1. **Apply Coded Value Filters**
   - Filter -1 (missing)
   - Filter -2 (not applicable)
   - Filter -3 (suppressed)
   - Document rows removed

2. **Calculate Quality Metrics**
   - Suppression rate
   - Missing value rates

   - Verify methodology is valid for source

4. **Generate Citation**
   - Full citation text
   - Data vintage
   - Access date

5. **Save Clean Data**

```

### Invocation Template: Domain Context Skill

**Purpose:** Apply source-specific cleaning and generate citations
**Stage:** 6 (Context Application)
**Subagent:** general-purpose
**Skills:** `data-scientist`, `{domain_context_skill}`

> **Domain extensibility:** The orchestrator resolves the context skill name based on the active domain (from the Plan's Domain Configuration) and provides it in the Agent prompt. The example below uses `education-data-context` as the demonstration domain default.

```python
task({
    description: "Stage 6: Context Application",
    prompt: """**BASE_DIR:** {BASE_DIR}
All relative paths in referenced files resolve from BASE_DIR.

Call the skill tool with name '{domain_context_skill}'.  # e.g., 'education-data-context'
If user has R/Stata background, also include: "User has [R/Stata] background. Load [r-python-translation/stata-python-translation] skill. Add inline [R/Stata]-equivalent comments for non-trivial data operations."

During execution, ACTIVELY MONITOR for watch-for symptoms. Escalate if detected.

**SUPPRESSION TOLERANCE (from Plan.md):**
- Target suppression rate: <{target}%
- WARNING threshold: {warning_threshold}%
- BLOCKER threshold: {blocker_threshold}%

**THOROUGHNESS DIRECTIVE:**
- Apply ALL coded value filters as specified
- Calculate suppression rate for key variables
- BLOCK if any governance rules from Plan Domain Configuration are violated (e.g., cross-state assessment comparison for education)
- BLOCK if suppression rate exceeds 50%
- Generate complete citation text with access date
- Document all cleaning decisions and row impacts

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return findings using the Research Executor Output Format
(see your agent protocol, § Output Format).

**Emphasis for this invocation:**
- Cleaning operations applied (coded value filters, row removal counts, suppression rates)
- Data quality metrics (CP2 status, original vs. clean row counts, loss percentage)
- Citation data (full citation text with access date) and file locations""",
    subagent_type: "research-executor"
})
```

### QA Follow-Up (MANDATORY)

**After research-executor completes EACH individual Stage 6 cleaning script, orchestrator MUST immediately invoke code-reviewer to separately review that script.**
Use the **code-reviewer invocation template** from `full-pipeline-mode.md`
with stage-specific values for Stage 6.

**Do NOT start the next Stage 6 script until QA returns PASSED or WARNING for the current script.**
**Do NOT proceed to Stage 7 until ALL Stage 6 scripts have been individually QA'd.**

**PSU Note:** Stage 6 concludes Phase 3. After all Stage 6 scripts are executed and QA'd, the orchestrator will present PSU3 to the user. The orchestrator compiles PSU3 from accumulated Stage 5-6 results -- no single agent produces the full PSU3 content.

### Validation (CP2)

```python
# Required checks
suppression_rate = (raw_df['key_var'] == SUPPRESSION_CODE).sum() / len(raw_df)  # SUPPRESSION_CODE from Plan Domain Configuration
assert suppression_rate < 0.5, f"STOP: Suppression {suppression_rate:.1%} > 50%"
assert len(clean_df) > len(raw_df) * 0.1, "STOP: >90% data loss"
```

### Output Format

```markdown
### Cleaning Applied:
- Coded values filtered: [summary by code]
- Rows removed: [count] ([percentage]%)

### Data Quality Report (CP2):
- Suppression rate: [percentage]
- Missing value summary: [by variable]
- **CP2 Status:** [PASSED | FAILED]

### Validity Check:
- Analysis type: [description]
- Valid: [Yes | No | Conditional]
- Warnings: [any concerns]

### Citation:
> [Full citation text]

### File Locations:
- Parquet: `data/processed/YYYY-MM-DD_[description].parquet`

### Scripts Saved (one per clean task):
- Path: `scripts/stage6_clean/{step}_{task-name}.py`
- Includes: Coded value filtering, suppression calculation, CP2 validation
- Note: Each clean task produces a separate script; QA is invoked immediately after each
```

### Gate Criteria (G6)

- [ ] Coded values handled
- [ ] CP2 passed
- [ ] Citation generated
- [ ] Data saved to `data/processed/`
- [ ] **All scripts saved to `scripts/stage6_clean/`** (one per clean task) with standard header
- [ ] **QA review completed for EACH Stage 6 script** (code-reviewer separately invoked immediately after each individual script, not batched)
- [ ] **All QA2 statuses:** PASSED/WARNING (any BLOCKER resolved via revision before next script)
- [ ] **QA scripts saved to `scripts/cr/stage6_{step}_cr1.py`** (+ cr2..cr5 if warranted)
- [ ] **STATE.md updated:** Current Stage: 6, CP2 status, suppression rate, processed data paths
- [ ] **PSU3 presented to user with data quality summary**
- [ ] **User confirmed PSU3**

---

### Phase Status Update 3 (PSU3): Data Acquired and Cleaned

**Trigger:** Gate G6 satisfied (all Stage 5-6 scripts executed and QA'd)
**Blocking:** YES — Stage 7 CANNOT begin until user confirms PSU3

**Actions:**
1. Compile data acquisition and cleaning summary from Stages 5-6
2. Include QA results from all QA1 and QA2 reviews
3. Present PSU3 to user using the PSU template
4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation

**PSU3 Content Requirements:**
- Datasets acquired: source name, shape (rows x columns), date range, file path
- Data freshness: most recent year available per source
- Data quality per dataset: missingness rates for critical columns, suppression rates
- Cleaning actions taken: rows removed (with counts and percentages), values recoded, filters applied
- QA summary table: each script's QA status (PASSED/WARNING) with details for any WARNINGs
- Any deviations from Plan.md during fetch or clean (documented per RULE 1-3)
- If data lag >= 3 years: explicit flag for user awareness
- If flag years (per FLAG_YEARS in Plan Domain Configuration) are included: explicit flag with documented warning
- Data readiness assessment: are the cleaned datasets ready for analysis?

**User Response Handling:**
- **Approve** → Proceed to Stage 7 (EDA & Transformation)
- **Request re-fetch** → Return to Stage 5 for specific datasets
- **Request different cleaning approach** → Return to Stage 6 with revised parameters
- **Flag concern about data quality** → Orchestrator investigates and reports back
- **Ask questions** → Answer, then re-present approval request

#### PSU3 Checkpoint Purpose

Include in the "Why this checkpoint" field:
> "I'm checking in to confirm the data is clean and trustworthy before running any statistics on it."

#### PSU3 Phase Transition Bridge

Include in the "What Comes Next" field:
> "The data is ready. Now comes the analysis itself — transformations, statistics, and visualizations, all following the plan we agreed on. Each script goes through a quality review. I'll compile all results and come back for one more checkpoint before writing the final report."

#### PSU3 Feedback Guidance

Include in the "What's Most Useful From You Here" field:
> "Are the data quality levels acceptable for your purposes? Any concerns about missing data rates or the cleaning decisions I made?"

#### PSU3 Content Requirements

The PSU3 checkpoint MUST include:
- Datasets acquired: source, shape, date range, file paths
- Data quality summary: missingness rates, suppression rates per dataset
- Cleaning actions taken and their impact (rows removed, values recoded)
- QA summary: QA1/QA2 results for each script (PASSED/WARNING with details)
- Any deviations from Plan.md during fetch/clean
- Data readiness assessment for analysis phase

### Post-Script Action Checklist (Stages 5-6)

After each script execution:
1. **QA:** Invoke code-reviewer immediately (see `full-pipeline-mode.md` > Code-Reviewer Invocation)
2. **State:** Update STATE.md transformation progress table
3. **Citations (Stage 6):** After each Stage 6 script completes, extract the data source citation from the research-executor's output (the `### Citation` section in the Stage 6 output format). Append the citation to STATE.md > Citations Accumulated > Data Sources table with the source name, full citation text, stage number, and script filename. If the citation already exists in the table (duplicate source), skip it.
4. **Next:** Proceed to next script in wave, or check gate if wave complete

## Quality Assurance

All analysis code underwent secondary QA review during execution:

| Checkpoint | Stage | What Was Validated | Status |
|------------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| QA1 | Data Fetch | Schema correctness, year coverage, ID uniqueness | PASSED |
| QA2 | Data Cleaning | Coded value handling, suppression calculation | PASSED |
| QA3 | Transformation | Join cardinality, row preservation, derived columns | PASSED |
| QA4a | Statistical Analysis | Statistical validity, assumption checks, sample sizes | PASSED |
| QA4b | Visualization | Figure accuracy, data source alignment | PASSED |

**QA Notes:**
- [Any resolved BLOCKERs: "A join cardinality issue was identified and corrected during Stage 7"]
- [Any logged WARNINGs: "Minor: Suppression rate approaches 30% in small school subset"]
- [Or: "No significant QA issues identified during execution"]

**QA Scripts:** `scripts/cr/` contains all QA inspection scripts for reproducibility.

## AI Use Disclosure

> This analysis was conducted using the **Data Analyst Augmentation Framework (DAAF)** (Kim, 2026), an open-source AI-assisted research orchestration system built on OMP (Anthropic). The following disclosure follows the GUIDE-LLM reporting checklist (Feuerriegel et al., 2026). For complete guidance, see `agent_reference/AI_DISCLOSURE_REFERENCE.md`.

**Date of analysis:** [AUTO — session date(s) from orchestrator date prefix]
**DAAF version:** [AUTO — short git commit hash captured at project setup]

### Role of AI in This Analysis (GUIDE-LLM A.1-A.2)

- **Purpose:** `[AUTO]` [Derived from Plan.md — e.g., "AI was used for data acquisition, cleaning script generation, transformation logic, statistical analysis code, and visualization generation. All code was reviewed through automated QA checkpoints and human oversight gates."]
- **Human oversight model:** `[AUTO]` Human-in-the-loop. The researcher reviewed and approved methodology (Checkpoint 2), data quality (Checkpoint 3), and analytical results (Checkpoint 4) before each phase advanced.

### Model & Configuration (GUIDE-LLM B.1-B.5)

| Item | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Model (session) | `[AUTO]` [Session model name and ID in use at session start, from STATE.md Session Metadata — e.g., Claude Opus 4.8 (claude-opus-4-8[1m])] | STATE.md Session Metadata |
| Specialist models | `[AUTO]` [Distinct subagent-tier model IDs actually dispatched, from STATE.md Subagent Model Tiers — e.g., "opus tier: claude-opus-4-8[1m]; sonnet tier: claude-sonnet-4-5". Record resolved IDs where known, or the tier alias + session date otherwise. See AI_DISCLOSURE_REFERENCE.md > Multi-Model Sessions.] | STATE.md Session Metadata |
| Provider | `[AUTO]` Anthropic [or the remapped provider(s) if alias env-var overrides were used] | — |
| Access method | `[AUTO]` OMP CLI (local execution via API) | — |
| Date of use | `[AUTO]` [Session date(s)] | STATE.md |
| Parameters | `[AUTO]` Default API parameters; no user-configured overrides | — |
| Customization | `[AUTO]` DAAF framework: domain-specific skills, agent definitions, and system instructions (see Technical Notes for repository link) | — |
| Session state | `[AUTO]` Stateful within sessions; STATE.md tracks cross-session continuity | — |

### Prompts & Instructions (GUIDE-LLM C.1-C.2)

`[AUTO]` All prompts and system instructions are version-controlled in the DAAF repository:
- System instructions: `AGENTS.md`
- Agent behavioral specifications: `.omp/agents/` directory
- Domain knowledge skills: `.omp/skills/` directory

### Data Privacy (GUIDE-LLM D.1)

`[RESEARCHER]` [Researcher must confirm: What data was submitted to the AI model? Was any personally identifiable information (PII) involved? Default for public federal data: "No personally identifiable information was submitted to the LLM. All data accessed was from public federal data sources."]

### Validation of AI Outputs (GUIDE-LLM E.1-E.2)

- **Automated code review:** `[AUTO]` All scripts underwent automated QA review by a separate AI instance (see Quality Assurance section above)
- **Human validation:** `[AUTO]` [Derived from STATE.md checkpoint statuses — e.g., "Researcher approved methodology at Checkpoint 2, verified data quality at Checkpoint 3, and validated analytical results at Checkpoint 4"]
- **Post-processing:** `[RESEARCHER]` [Researcher documents any manual edits made to AI-generated outputs after delivery. Default if none: "No manual post-processing was applied to AI-generated outputs."]

### Reproducibility (GUIDE-LLM F.1)

`[AUTO]`
- All analysis scripts with execution logs: `scripts/` directory
- Consolidated analytic notebook: `[notebook filename]`
- Session transcript(s): `logs/` directory (full JSONL + human-readable MD for each work session)

### Funding & Conflicts of Interest (GUIDE-LLM G.1)

`[RESEARCHER]` [Researcher must disclose: Funding sources for this research, approximate API costs incurred, and any relevant relationships with AI providers or other potential conflicts of interest.]

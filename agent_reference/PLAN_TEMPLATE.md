# [Analysis Title]

**Key Principles:**

1. **Task actions must be specific enough to execute without clarification.**
   - Invalid: "Process the data appropriately"
   - Valid: "Filter rows where enrollment == -1, save to data/processed/2026-01-31_ccd_clean.parquet"

2. **File paths must be explicit (no placeholders in the final plan).**
   - Invalid: `data/raw/[filename].parquet`
   - Valid: `data/raw/2026-01-31_ccd_schools.parquet`

3. **Verification must be executable (not subjective).**
   - Invalid: "Data looks correct"
   - Valid: "Row count > 0 AND row count < 200000"

4. **Done criteria must be measurable.**
   - Invalid: "Task complete"
   - Valid: "CP1 PASSED, files saved to data/raw/"

## Must-Haves (Goal-Backward Verification)

**Purpose:** This section defines what must be rigorously investigated and produced for the analysis to be considered complete. Derived using goal-backward methodology — working from the research question to identify research outcomes, required artifacts, and critical connections.

### Deriving Must-Haves

**Goal-backward planning asks:** "What must be EXAMINED for the research question to be rigorously answered?" rather than "What should we build?"

**Step 1: State the Goal (Outcome, Not Task)**
- Good: "Analysis characterizes enrollment trends by poverty level" (outcome)
- Bad: "Create enrollment visualization" (task)

**Step 2: Derive Research Outcomes (What Must Be Investigated)**
Ask: "What must be EXAMINED for this research question to be rigorously answered?"
List 3-7 outcomes that define the scope of rigorous investigation. Each outcome states what must be measured, characterized, or reported — not what the result should be.

- Good: "Relationship between poverty rate and enrollment is characterized (direction, magnitude, significance)"
- Bad: "Poverty is negatively correlated with enrollment (expect r < -0.3)"

Research outcomes define the **scope and rigor** of the investigation. They are assessed as ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED based on whether the analysis thoroughly investigated and reported on the stated topic. Surprising or null findings are equally valid — the outcome is ADDRESSED if the investigation was rigorous.

**Step 2b: State Hypotheses (Optional — Pre-Registration)**
If prior literature, domain knowledge, or theory suggests directional expectations, state them transparently as hypotheses with their basis. Hypotheses are pre-registered predictions, not success criteria. A rigorously refuted hypothesis is excellent science.

- Each hypothesis must include an `id`, `statement`, and `basis` (citation or rationale)
- Hypotheses are assessed as SUPPORTED / NOT SUPPORTED / PARTIALLY SUPPORTED
- Either outcome is equally valid and informative
- Hypotheses belong here, NOT in research outcomes — any directional prediction in a research outcome should be moved to this section

**Step 3: Derive Required Artifacts**
For each research outcome, ask: "What must EXIST for this to be investigated?"
Identify specific files with expected content.

**Step 4: Identify Key Links (Critical Connections)**
Ask: "Where is this most likely to break?"
Key links are connections that, if missing, cause cascading failures.

### Common Must-Have Failures

| Failure Type | Bad Example | Good Example |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Outcomes too vague** | "Analysis is complete" | "Year-over-year enrollment change is measured and reported with statistical significance testing" |
| **Outcomes not verifiable** | "Data is clean" | "No coded values (-1, -2, -3) remain in analysis columns" |
| **Outcomes are confirmatory** | "Poverty is negatively correlated with enrollment (expect r < -0.3)" | "Relationship between poverty rate and enrollment is characterized (direction, magnitude, significance, confidence intervals)" |
| **Hypotheses missing basis** | "We expect r > 0.5" | "H1: Based on Smith et al. 2020 selectivity literature, we expect \|r\| > 0.5 between admission rate and graduation rate" |
| **Artifacts too abstract** | "Analysis files" | "research/2026-01-31_School_Poverty/2026-01-31_School_Poverty.py" |
| **Artifacts missing content spec** | path only | path + provides + contains/has_columns |
| **Missing wiring** | Listing files without connections | "Notebook loads from data/processed/ via pl.read_parquet()" |
| **Key links too generic** | "Notebook uses data" | "Cell 3 loads YYYY-MM-DD_analysis.parquet with enrollment, frl columns" |

[Repeat structure]

### Data Freshness Check

**IMPORTANT:** This section is populated during Stage 5 (CP1 validation). If significant lag is discovered, the orchestrator MUST update the user before proceeding.

| Source | Requested Years | Latest Available | Lag | Impact | User Notified? |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|-----|--------|----------------|
| CCD | 2020-2023 | 2023 | 0 years | ✅ Current | N/A |
| CRDC | 2020-2021 | 2021 | 1 year | ✅ Acceptable | N/A |
| [add row per source] | | | | | |

**Lag Assessment Guidelines:**
- **No lag (0 years):** Data is current ✅ — Proceed normally
- **Minor lag (1-2 years):** Acceptable for most analyses ✅ — Document in report
- **Significant lag (3+ years):** ⚠️ **MUST update user before proceeding**
  - Explain the lag and its implications
  - Offer options: proceed with caveat, adjust year range, wait for updated data
  - Document user decision in Decisions Log

**Orchestrator Protocol for Significant Lag:**
If CP1 Check 6 detects lag ≥3 years:
1. PAUSE execution after Stage 5
2. Update this table with lag details
3. Report to user:
   ```
   **Data Lag Detected**
   Requested: {max_year_requested}
   Latest available: {max_year_available}
   Lag: {lag_years} years
   
   Options:
   1. Proceed with {max_year_available} data (document limitation)
   2. Adjust analysis to {revised_year_range}
   3. Wait for {expected_release_date}
   
   How would you like to proceed?
   ```
4. Document decision in Decisions Log
5. Update analysis scope if years changed

**COVID-19 Data Quality Considerations:**
If analysis includes 2020 or 2021 data, CP1 Check 7 will flag this automatically. Document the following:

| Year | Data Quality Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| 2020 | [Collection disruptions, missing data, non-representative samples] | [Exclude year, document caveat, compare to pre/post-COVID trends] |
| 2021 | [Recovery period, partial return to normal collection] | [Document caveat, note recovery status] |

**Note:** Data freshness verified during Stage 5 (CP1 Check 6). COVID impact flagged by CP1 Check 7. Both are updated before proceeding to Stage 6.

### Data Cleaning Specification

**Coded Value Handling:**

*For complete coded value definitions, invoke the domain context skill (per Domain Configuration) via subagent.*

| Variable | Codes to Filter | Rationale |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| `enrollment` | -1, -2 | Missing/not applicable (domain-specific codes per Domain Configuration) |
| `frl` | -1, -2, -3 | Missing/not applicable/suppressed (domain-specific codes per Domain Configuration) |

**Suppression Handling:**

- Expected suppression rate: [X]%
- Threshold for STOP condition: 50%
- If exceeded: [escalate to user | aggregate to higher level | document and proceed]

### Transformation Sequence

**IMPORTANT:** Execute transformations following the workflowz Wave-Based Execution Protocol. Tasks in the same wave can run in parallel with independent subagent contexts. Tasks in later waves must wait for all prior waves to complete.

#### Wave-Based Task Table

| Wave | Step | Task Name | Operation | Expected Outcome | Script Path | Cardinality | Depends On |
|------|------|-----------|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 1.1 | fetch-ccd | Fetch CCD schools data | ~100K rows | `scripts/stage5_fetch/01_fetch-ccd.py` | N/A | — |
| 1 | 1.2 | fetch-meps | Fetch MEPS poverty data | ~100K rows | `scripts/stage5_fetch/02_fetch-meps.py` | N/A | — |
| 2 | 2.1 | clean-ccd | Filter coded values | ~95K rows (5% loss) | `scripts/stage6_clean/01_clean-ccd.py` | N/A | 1.1 |
| 2 | 2.2 | clean-meps | Filter coded values | ~98K rows (2% loss) | `scripts/stage6_clean/02_clean-meps.py` | N/A | 1.2 |
| 3 | 3.1 | join-data | Join CCD + MEPS on ncessch | ~93K rows | `scripts/stage7_transform/01_join-data.py` | 1:1 | 2.1, 2.2 |
| 4 | 4.1 | filter-state | Filter to FIPS == 6 (CA) | ~9K rows (10% retained) | `scripts/stage7_transform/02_filter-state.py` | N/A | 3.1 |
| 4 | 4.2 | calc-ratio | Calculate student-teacher ratio | Add 1 column | `scripts/stage7_transform/03_calc-ratio.py` | N/A | 3.1 |
| 5 | 5.1 | aggregate | Aggregate by district | ~1K rows | `scripts/stage7_transform/04_aggregate.py` | N/A | 4.1, 4.2 |

**Script Path Convention:**
- Pattern: `scripts/stage{N}_{type}/{step:02d}_{task-name}.py`
- Stage 5 (fetch) → `scripts/stage5_fetch/`
- Stage 6 (clean) → `scripts/stage6_clean/`
- Stage 7 (transform) → `scripts/stage7_transform/`
- Stage 8 (analysis & viz) → `scripts/stage8_analysis/`

> **Full Task Definitions:** The complete XML task specifications for each entry in this table are in the companion `Plan_Tasks.md` file. See `agent_reference/PLAN_TASKS_TEMPLATE.md` for the task definition template.

### Stage Interface Specifications

Define the expected data contracts between stages. The data-planner populates these during Plan creation. Code-reviewer validates against them during QA.

#### Stage 5 → Stage 6 (Raw → Clean)
- **Artifact pattern:** `data/raw/{date}_{source}.parquet`
- **Expected columns:** [list key columns per dataset]
- **Row count range:** [estimated min-max]
- **Key invariants:** [e.g., "year column is not null", "ncessch is unique per year"]

#### Stage 6 → Stage 7 (Clean → Transform)
- **Artifact pattern:** `data/processed/{date}_{source}_clean.parquet`
- **Expected columns:** [columns surviving cleaning]
- **Row count range:** [post-cleaning estimate]
- **Key invariants:** [e.g., "no coded missing values remain in critical columns"]

#### Stage 7 → Stage 8 (Transform → Analysis)
- **Artifact pattern:** `data/processed/{date}_analysis.parquet`
- **Expected columns:** [final analysis columns including derived variables]
- **Row count range:** [post-transformation estimate]
- **Key invariants:** [e.g., "one row per school per year", "poverty_rate between 0 and 1"]

*Populate the bracketed fields with specifics for this analysis. Add or remove interface sections as needed based on the actual stage sequence.*

| Unexpected NAs | 0 | >10% NAs in derived columns |

### CP4: Before Output

**Expected Values:**

| Check | Expected | STOP If |
|-------|----------|---------|
| All planned figures generated | Yes | Missing figures |
| Report sections complete | Yes | Missing sections |
| Notebook runs without error | Yes | Execution errors |

### QA Tolerance Decisions

*Document project-specific tolerance thresholds and WHY they differ from defaults (if they do).
Code-reviewer uses these to calibrate BLOCKER vs WARNING severity.*

| Check | Default Threshold | Project Threshold | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Suppression rate | <50% STOP | [Same or custom] | [Why, if different] |
| Join row loss | <10% acceptable | [Same or custom] | [Why, if different] |
| [Custom check] | [N/A] | [threshold] | [rationale] |

## Decisions Log

> **Frozen after Stage 4.5.** This section captures planning-phase decisions only. All runtime decisions made during Stages 5-12 are recorded in STATE.md `## Key Decisions Made`.

| Decision | Options Considered | Choice Made | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Data source | CCD vs. PSS | CCD | Research question focuses on public schools |
| Year range | 2018-2022 vs. 2020-2022 | 2020-2022 | Recent years sufficient; avoids COVID transition |
| Suppression handling | Exclude vs. Impute | Exclude | Imputation would introduce bias |

### Key Decision Detail

*For decisions where multiple valid approaches existed, document the full reasoning.
Skip this for obvious choices (e.g., "CCD because the question is about public schools").*

#### [Decision Title] (e.g., "Poverty Measure Selection")
**Question:** [The ambiguity that needed resolution]
**Options:**
1. [Option A] — [Implications if chosen]
2. [Option B] — [Implications if chosen]

**Resolution:** [Which option chosen]
**Rationale:** [Why]
**Decided By:** [User | Agent (within autonomous scope)]

## Risk Register

Document risks identified during discovery and planning, with mitigation strategies.

> **Frozen after Stage 4.5.** This section captures planning-phase risks identified during Stages 1-4. Risks discovered during execution (Stages 5-12) are recorded in STATE.md `## Runtime Risks`.

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner/Stage |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| High suppression in key variable | Medium | High | Aggregate to district level if >30%; proceed with caveat if 30-50% | Stage 6 |
| COVID data quality issues (2020) | High | Medium | Exclude 2020 or document caveat prominently | Stage 3 |
| Cross-state variation in reporting | Medium | Medium | Check CRDC state-specific notes; restrict to comparable states | Stage 3 |

**Risk Categories:**
- **Data Availability:** Risk that needed data doesn't exist or has insufficient coverage
- **Data Quality:** Risk of high suppression, missingness, or known collection issues
- **Methodological:** Risk that analysis approach may not be valid for this data
- **Scope:** Risk that analysis scope is too broad or complex
- **Timeline:** Risk that data sources have unexpected lag times
- **QA:** Risk that secondary validation will find issues requiring revision or escalation

**Update Triggers:** See `full-pipeline-mode.md` > "Runtime Risk Tracking" for complete trigger list. Planning-phase risks are documented here; runtime risks go to STATE.md `## Runtime Risks`.

**When to Update (during planning, Stages 1-4 only):**
- **Stage 3 (Source Deep-Dive):** Add risks from source caveats that affect validity/completeness
- **Any planning stage:** Add risks when data definitions changed between years or other quality issues arise

> **Execution-phase risks** (Stage 5+), such as unexpected row loss or cardinality violations, are recorded in STATE.md `## Runtime Risks`.

## Trade-offs Accepted

*Explicit acknowledgment of what was sacrificed for what benefit.
Every non-trivial analysis involves trade-offs — document them here so stakeholders
and QA reviewers understand what was intentionally accepted.*

| We Accepted | In Order To | Downside |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| [e.g., Older data (2022 vs 2023)] | [Use MEPS poverty measure] | [1-year lag] |
| [e.g., State-only scope] | [Avoid cross-state comparability issues] | [Less generalizable] |
